Strategies for Sketching Interfaces

Before you start to Make an interface, a ton of thinking goes on . The 4-corners canvas provides a way for you to think with your team before you make the interface . 4-corners embeds user-centered thinking into the design process . With the thinking done, you can move on to mak- ing the interface .
Different sketching activities offer teams unique advantages . We’ll look at three specific activities:
Group sketching to create a single, shared vision
Individual sketching to reveal multiple perspectives within a group
6-8-5 sketching to generate multiple variations for individual screens
Each of these activities helps your team or clients sketch a model of an interface . When you use 4-corners and collaborate on a sketch, your  team learns how to make better interfaces . If this sketching continues your thinking with the 4-corners (from the previous  chapter),  refer  to the topics you and the team just discussed .

Activity: Group Sketching to Create a Single, Shared Vision
When you sketch with a group, the team collaborates to draft a single version of a screen . This is useful when you believe the primary prob- lem is not what  the  interface  should  look  like,  but  getting  everyone to agree . Group sketching creates a shared vision  of  what  the  inter- face should look like . Use the collaboration roadmap to keep the team focused . Start with the frame, facilitate sketching, and finish  with  a final version of the sketch .

THE FRAME

WHAT WILL YOU DO?
Sketch an interface
WHAT’S THE OUTCOME?
a single sketch of the interface

WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
Provides a sketch we can check with other stakeholders and build off of

HOW WILL YOU DO IT?
Sketch the interface’s layout, including content and functionality
To frame group sketching, say:

“Let’s sketch the interface together, so we have a first draft of what we want to build. keeping our 4-corners in mind, let’s take our prioritized lists of content and functionality and lay out the screen.”

FACILITATE GROUP SKETCHING
Blank canvases daunt timid teams . Seed participation  by  adding  the first piece . Sketch the most prominent piece of content or functionality  to get collaboration rolling . Adding the first piece shows the team what to do, demonstrates how easy it is, and provides a straw man your team can react to .
For our Product Detail screen, you might  draw  the  product  image  at the top left of the screen (Figure 19-1) . Narrate what you are doing . Ask the team:

“What if we put the product image at the top left?”

When you describe where you put the image as a question instead of as statement, you signal to the team that the idea is open for discussion .

Avoid closing down options
In Fast Company, Leigh Thompson, a management professor at the Kellogg School, warns how the first idea risks closing off alternatives .1 As a facilitator, don’t force your ideas on the group . Successful collabo- ration reveals consensus around the group’s idea, not your idea .

Narrating with questions keeps discussion open, but it’s not enough . People, eager to please, will agree with your reasonable suggestion  rather than suggest a conflicting idea . Generate alternative, conflicting ideas with direct questions . For the product image, you could ask prob- ing questions, like:
Where else could we put the image?
Where do our competitors place the product image? Should we do the same or choose to be different?
What problems does the product image cause if it’s at the top left?
What if we don’t have a product image?
Will different products have different size images? What if there’s a video? Will we ever want to display a product a different way?
Probing questions will be different for every screen . Each interface solves a different user problem with different sets of content and func- tionality . Push the team to think of other options .
A room full of quiet participants is like an empty canvas . People hesitate to talk first . Successful collaboration requires that you include everyone . If the room is too quiet, direct questions to specific team  members . When questioned directly, the team member should respond . This changes the activity from you leading to two people talking .
If the first participant agrees too quickly, direct the same question to another participant . However, if everyone is well-aligned, it’s possible there’s no useful discussion to be had .  Continue to sketch the rest of    the interface .
