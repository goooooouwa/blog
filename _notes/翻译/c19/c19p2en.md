Encourage participation by being wrong
A coworker likes to hide a bad idea in a list of good ideas . The bad idea provides something that’s easy and safe for participants to react to and disagree with .
For the Product Detail screen, place things where they typically wouldn’t go or suggest that something like a button should be in an uncommon place . You could sketch the “Add to cart” button at the very bottom of a very long screen and hope someone pushes to display the button higher on the screen . You can also place a secondary or tertiary call to action more prominently than the primary call to action . This will trigger team members to speak up .


Hand sketching duties to active participants
When discussion goes well, the ideas, comments,  and  feedback  flow fast and furious . When a participant offers a more involved idea or comment, hand them the marker so they can sketch . You can say:

“I’m not sure what that looks like. Can you draw it for me?”

In teams where everyone feels included and  trusted,  team  members  will jump up to sketch . Encourage others to sketch as often as possible . If teammates decline to take the marker, ask them again more force-   fully . Say:

“here. Draw what you’re talking about.”

Get help sketching because you’re busy
If you still can’t get participants to contribute to the sketch, have them take over by necessity . In a sketching exercise, someone has to sketch .  If you’re at the board with the marker, then your team has no obligation  to sketch anything . Make yourself unable to sketch to place the obliga- tion on them .
To hand off sketching duties, invent a reason to  get  away  from  the board . Decide to look up something that’s relevant to the current dis- cussion . Find the person closest to the board and ask them to cover for you while you’re busy . You can say:

“Can you take the marker for a second? I need to look something up.”

Hand them the marker . Socially, it’s difficult not to accept something that’s handed to you . Your team member will take the marker, and you can move to the back of the room . Continue to facilitate the discussion, so the marker holder only needs to sketch .

Iterate frequently
Some people have no problem tossing their first  draft  and  starting  again . Others cling to that first, precious idea . Encourage the team to iterate by starting over again and again .


When you iterate, draw an “x” over the first sketch and start another   next to it . Sketching’s speed means you can start and finish  a  new sketch in a matter of seconds . Model frequent iteration, so your team learns how fast and easy it is .
If someone else is sketching, encourage them to sketch alternate ver- sions and iterate .

THE FINISH
After you have sketched, discussed, and iterated on the interface layout, and the team has reached a consensus, close the conversation around the final sketch .
If necessary, create a neat, clean version of the sketch, so the content, functionality, and layout are clear . Name or describe critical boxes or squig- gles, so the team doesn’t forget . If you’re using the 4-corners canvas, make sure the user, task, and other information are clear, and double-check that the sketch has a clear title . Take a photo or save the document, and share the sketch with everyone as soon as possible .
Remind the team you will share the sketch, so they know what to expect:

“I’ll save this and share the sketch with everyone as soon as we’re done here.”

If you’re  sketching several screens in one session, move on to frame     the next screen . You can sketch, discuss, and iterate a screen in as little  as 10 minutes . More complex screens may take as long as 30 minutes . Most teams can sketch several screens in a user’s journey in as little as  30 minutes .
Group sketching aligns the team around a single, shared vision of the interface . Shared vision allows the team to work together and apart and creates a shared language and understanding for how the team talks about and works through the experience, from concept all the way through launch . The shared vision helps your team build better experiences, and you help them learn how when you facilitate group sketching activities .


Sometimes, the team’s not ready to create a shared vision .  The team  may have several  disparate,  competing  visions  floating  around  in  their heads, or may have chosen a direction without evaluating all the options . This is what happened in my workshop where participants sketched 15 different versions of the homepage .
