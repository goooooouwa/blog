Highlight and discuss the range of variations
Although several sketches will look similar, rarely will two look the same . Individual sketching generates alternative ideas for the screen and reinforces the idea that everyone on the team has a unique per- spective and picture in their head . Learning that everyone has a differ- ent idea in their head illustrates the value of collaboration and a shared vision .


Ask team members to present their sketch to the group . Identify com- mon features . Highlight differences . Usually a few sketches are totally unlike the others . Ask sketch owners why they sketched the screen the way they did . Make sure to timebox each presentation to two or three minutes .

THE FINISH
The ultimate goal is a single sketch of the screen that everyone agrees   on . After you discuss the different versions, lead a group sketching exercise (from earlier in this chapter) to create a single, shared vision .

Activity: 6-8-5 Sketching to Generate Multiple Directions
Individual sketching explores a wide range of  options .  This  helps  teams avoid choosing a direction before they’ve considered alternatives . However, each participant may have individually settled on a direction before thinking about possible variations .
To help individual participants expand  their  thinking,  each  partici-  pant sketches multiple versions . Adaptive Path, Todd Warfel, and Russ Unger each popularized this method, sometimes  called  6-8-5  sketch- ing . In 6-8-5 sketching, each participant creates 6–8 variations of a screen in 5 minutes .  Focus less on the 5-minute time limit and more     on each participant sketching multiple variations .
While individual sketching works great with diverse groups of stake- holders, 6-8-5 sketching offers the opportunity to explore a wide range   of variations even in homogenous groups .
You can use 6-8-5 sketching in lots of situations because it only needs two things:
Some paper
Something to write with

PREPARE THE MATERIALS
In addition to something to write with, there’s a bit of preparation involved . Either use a sketching worksheet with 6–8 areas for users  to sketch in, or have participants fold a blank piece of paper to create 8 subdivided sections where they can sketch:


Fold the paper in half . This divides the paper into two parts .
Fold the paper in half again to divide it into four sections .
Fold the paper in half one more time to divide it into eight sections .
When participants have a worksheet or have folded their paper to create the sections, you can facilitate the 6-8-5 exercise:
At the top left of the page, write the name of the screen you will sketch .
Start the timer and give everyone 5 minutes to sketch 6–8 versions  of the screen .
Participants sketch a version of the screen in each section of the paper .

THE FRAME
Like with other sketching exercises, the team should already have  a sense of the product’s users as well as a vision about the product’s end state . The shared vision constrains the sketches . Set a frame similar to when the team does individual sketching .

WHAT WILL YOU DO?
Identify multiple alternatives for an interface
WHAT’S THE OUTCOME?
6–8 sketches from each participant
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
helps identify multiple ideas to make the interface better
HOW WILL YOU DO IT?
Each participant will sketch 6–8 versions of the screen

To encourage each team member to provide their viewpoint, frame 6-8-5 sketching around their perspective . For the Product Detail screen, you might say:

“Let’s sketch the Product Detail screen. Everyone should grab a piece of paper and a pen, so you can each sketch six different versions of what you think the Product Detail screen should look like. When I start the timer, sketch at least six versions of the Product Detail screen on your page. Try and sketch as many different versions as possible.”

If someone asks what you mean by different versions, explain that a different version can have different content, layout, organization, strat- egy, or approach .

FACILITATE 6-8-5 SKETCHING
Count down time, share, and discuss
Like with individual sketching, count down the time to keep everyone on track, then have everyone share and discuss their sketches .
To share and discuss, have each participant present their 6–8 variations  to the rest of the group .  Highlight similarities and differences .  Help   the group find unique ideas that offer content or functionality the user would find especially useful .
