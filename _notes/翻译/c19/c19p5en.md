Use groups to limit share time
Because each participant should share,  6-8-5  sketching  works  best  with 5–7 participants . If there are  more  participants  than  that,  shar- ing may take so long that some participants will lose interest . If you  have 8 or more participants, break the room into groups of 4–5 people . Participants can share and discuss their sketches with their group .
After everyone has shared their 6–8 variations with their group, have the group sketch the screen together, so the group finishes with one screen that combines the group’s best thinking . When each group is down to a single screen, you can have each group share their screen with the broader group . Highlight and discuss the range of variations just as you would with individual sketching .

THE FINISH
Like individual sketching, follow 6-8-5 sketching with group sketching  to create a single, shared vision of the screen .

Additional Things to Think About When Sketching
UNFRAMED SKETCHING
Both individual sketching and 6-8-5 sketching reveal alternative approaches to an interface . To encourage as much diversity as possible, frame the screen as generally as possible . For example, you would ask everyone to sketch a Product Detail screen without describing the con- tent or functionality that should appear on the screen .
Without explicit framing, it’s easier for team members to rely on their preconceived notions about what content and functionality should appear, how the screen should be laid out, and how users will interact with the functionality . Give the team wide latitude to envision how the interface will function to allow a broader set of variations to emerge .
Without explicit framing, individual and 6-8-5 sketching identify a wide range of possible content, functionality, layouts, and interaction models . A lack of explicit framing provides an alternative method for generating lists of content and functionality that’s different from the generation you do as a group with the 4-corners model .


FRAMED SKETCHING
Individual generation answers the question: what should the interface include? However, if you have already aligned on what the interface should include, you may only want to answer the question: how should the interface appear?
If you only want to generate variations in how the interface appears and not what it should include, then frame sketching activities using the 4-corners . Aligned on content and functionality, your team will focus on generating variations in the layout and how users interact with the content and functionality .
Before sketching, ask yourself if the team needs to align on layout and interaction, or if they also need to align on content and functionality .

SYNTHESIZE MULTIPLE VARIATIONS
At the end of the day, the team will only build one version of the Product Detail screen, so they need to synthesize several variations into one model of the interface . Both individual and 6-8-5 sketching create sev- eral variations for an individual interface . Group sketching aligns the team on a single sketch for the interface .

WHAT IF THE GROUP CAN’T DECIDE ON A SINGLE VARIATION?
Sometimes, the group is ready to align on a single version of the inter- face . Sometimes, team members disagree on how the interface should function . Knowing you don’t  agree is just as valuable as knowing you  do . When teams can’t decide to proceed with a single version, sketch competing versions you can check and test . Competing variations will differ in either layout, interaction, or both .
When a team can’t choose a single approach, that means they lack a shared understanding of an underlying assumption . When you cre-  ate competing variations to Check, the team can evaluate competing assumptions and align on a specific direction .

Layout variations
With layout variations, the team can’t decide where content and func- tionality should appear . With a Product Detail screen, the team might split on whether the product image appears at the top right or the top left of the screen . Or maybe they disagree on whether the “Add to cart” button appears closer to the top or the bottom of the screen .


In both cases, the team wants to understand what layout best helps users achieve their task and move to the next step . What layout best helps the user to decide to buy the product? What layout best helps the user add the product to their cart? What layout is most useful to the user?
When you create alternative layouts, you can evaluate which layout is most useful .

Interaction variations
With interaction variations, the team can’t decide how to make the interface most usable . If the user chooses from multiple options, is it more usable to have the user select an option from a drop-down? Or  is it more usable for the user to choose from one of several radio but- tons? Even if both variations have similar layouts, you can check each interaction—select box or radio buttons—to determine what method  is most usable .
