Trust Others to Make Interfaces on Their Own
When you work through the 4-corners a few  times  with  your  team, your team starts to think like designers . When they approach screens, they’ll think about the user, the task, and the previous and next steps . They’ll list and prioritize content and functionality before they start to design the screen . They’ll design better experiences, and you helped them do it .
Introducing your team to 4-corners changes the way they think . The  team shares a vision about what goes into good screen design, so trust your team to create their own sketches and wireframes without you .  Trust the decisions they make, the designs they create, and that they    will reach out when they need expertise or feedback .
Instead of designing every screen, help the team create better screens . Help the team design better . A couple of tactics help your teams design better without you .


MAKE 4-CORNERS EASILY ACCESSIBLE
It’s easier to fill out a worksheet than think about something in the abstract .  Make 4-corners materials easy to find and use .  Leave stacks  of worksheets in common areas . Link to templates on team wikis and project sites . Attach the 4-corners worksheet to tasks in tracking sys- tems like TFS and JIRA . When 4-corners worksheets and checklists are easier to find and use, more people will find and use them .

CREATE A RITUAL
For 10 years, every night before bed, I brushed my teeth with the kids . We  all go into the bathroom, put toothpaste on our toothbrushes, count  to three, say go, and then brush our teeth while  we  hum  the  ABCs twice . Every night . A couple of years ago, we added mouthwash and flossing to our nightly ritual .
Now, if the kids brush their teeth on their own, they follow the same ritual . They count, say go, brush while they say the ABCs twice, floss, and use mouthwash .
To make 4-corners part of your team’s ritual, observe the ritual yourself where everyone can see . When you model behavior, yourself, others learn how to do it and how easy it is to get the benefits .

SOLVE TEAM PROBLEMS, NOT DESIGN PROBLEMS
When you collaborate on an interface, your team works through one of two, basic problems:
How can the team align multiple visions into one, shared vision?
How can the team evaluate the success of a screen?
When you collaborate on interfaces, you help teams work through these problems . When you make an interface with your team, collaboration identifies and solves specific questions the team doesn’t  even  know  they have . When you reveal and answer these questions, you improve  the final interface . And your team members take those learnings with them throughout the experience machine .
With 4-corners and sketching, the low-fidelity sketch includes content, functionality, and layout . However, as an interface model, the limited fidelity of the sketches restricts how well you can model content, func- tionality, visual design, and context .


Sketches only let you model and test so much . When you make an inter- face, what if the sketch won’t let you check what you want to check? 4-corners and sketching provide one way to think about and make an interface at a specific fidelity to answer specific questions . How do you know when to create a sketch versus a wireframe or prototype? How do you make the right interface? We’ll find out in the next chapter .
