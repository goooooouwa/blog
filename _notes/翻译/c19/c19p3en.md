Activity: Individual Sketching to Reveal Competing Perspectives
Although a single direction for your interface will align the team, you might not be ready for a single vision . Team members may have com- peting ideas that need to be discussed before you align on a single direction . Individual sketching helps teams reveal and discuss com- peting visions . If you believe the team has prematurely decided on a direction, individual sketching helps teams generate multiple options . Individual sketching is especially useful on contentious screens like homepages and landing screens where competing groups have differ-    ent priorities .
To generate multiple, competing versions, everyone will sketch the  screen on their own before sharing with the group .

THE FRAME

WHAT WILL YOU DO?
Identify multiple alternatives for an interface
WHAT’S THE OUTCOME?
an individual sketch from each participant

WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
helps identify competing ideas to make the interface better
HOW WILL YOU DO IT?
Each participant will sketch a version of the screen
With individual sketching, you want to generate many different options . In keeping with this goal, frame the activity with as little direction as possible . Don’t close down options by directing participants toward a specific solution .
To encourage options from each team member’s perspective, frame individual sketching around their individual perspective . For the Product Detail screen, you might say:

“Let’s sketch the Product Detail screen. Everyone grab a piece of paper and a pen and sketch what you think the Product Detail screen should look like.”


When you focus on individual perspectives, you encourage diverse groups of stakeholders to focus on their unique perspective .
If you want to generate multiple options and your team has similar per- spectives, frame the activity to focus on generating alternate versions . For the Product Detail screen, you could say:

“Let’s sketch as many different variations of a Product Detail screen as we can. This will help us think of different ways to improve the inter- face. Everyone take 3 minutes to sketch a different way we could build the Product Detail screen.”

FACILITATE INDIVIDUAL SKETCHING
Regardless of how you frame individual sketching, run the exercise the same way .

Pass out materials and start sketching
Pass out 1 or 2 blank sheets of paper and a pen or marker to each par- ticipant . Make sure everyone has the supplies they need to participate . Say:

“Does everyone have some paper and something to write with?”

Once everyone is ready, repeat the instructions from the frame, tell the team how much time they have, and start the timer . For the Product Detail screen, you could say:

“We will take 3 minutes, so everyone can sketch the Product Detail screen. I will start the timer now.”

Keep participants on track
As everyone starts to sketch, move around and check on each partici- pant . Look at each person’s sketch . Some people start right away . Others sit and think before they start . Some team members will need clarifica- tion .  Check on everyone so unsure participants have the chance to ask    a question in private . If you find someone who looks perplexed, ask if they have a question and help get them started .


Some participants will be unsure about what’s allowed . They’re afraid  of the blank canvas or sketching the wrong thing . Reassure them that they can sketch anything as long as it’s a Product Detail screen .
Some participants will want to clarify things like whether they should sketch for mobile or desktop . Again, anything goes . Reassure them that they can sketch anything .  Help them make a choice by asking: “What  do you want to sketch? The mobile version or the desktop version?”

Count down the time
An impending deadline gives the team the push  they  need  to  get  started . Announce each minute as it passes . Tell the room when there  are 2 minutes left, 1 minute, 30 seconds, and 10 seconds .
The countdown also helps participants bring their individual sketches to a point of completion, so the activity ends with a sketch from every- one . When everyone contributes a sketch, you include everyone and build trust that supports later collaboration .

Collect and share individual sketches
When time has ended, announce that time is up and collect everyone’s sketches . Say:

“Time’s up. finish what you’re working on and let’s share what we did.”

Ideally, tape each sketch on a wall or place them on a table where every- one can see the different versions side-by-side . Have each participant tape their sketch on the wall to get everyone out of their seats and mov- ing around to help fight the collaboration doldrums .
