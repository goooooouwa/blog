PRIORITIZE NEXT STEPS
Faced with more than one next step, work through the prioritization questions to rank next steps from most to least important (Figure 18-7):
What next step will the user visit most frequently?
If you can design this screen to drive users to only one next step, where would you send users?
What next screen must users be able to get to?
What next screen creates the most value for your users?
What next screen creates the most value for your organization?

FINISH AND DISCUSS THE PREVIOUS STEP
Note the primary next step at the bottom right of the canvas and tell the team you’re ready to focus on the user’s previous step:

“Let’s talk about where the user came from.”

Activity 4: Identify the Previous Step
You ask where the user came from, so that when they arrive on the screen, you make sure everything makes sense . You want to make sure the user doesn’t get lost, they’re appropriately welcomed, and they can get to the next step in their journey .
If users arrive at the Product Detail screen and don’t see what they expect or what they’re looking for, they’ll hit the back button . To get the user to the next step, keep the user on this screen . To optimize this screen to maximize conversions, you need a strong link between where they came from and where they’re going .
To think about the previous step, the team will discuss and prioritize possible previous steps and identify the most important ones .

THE FRAME

WHAT WILL YOU DO?
Discuss all the ways the user may arrive at this screen
WHAT’S THE OUTCOME?
The most important previous step
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
helps optimize the screen layout and design

HOW WILL YOU DO IT?
List and prioritize all the ways a user can arrive at this screen.
To frame discussion around previous steps, say:

“Let’s figure out where users will come from, so we make sure the screen reflects what the users expect. Let’s list the possible previous steps, and then choose the most important.”


FACILITATE DISCUSSION ABOUT PREVIOUS STEPS
In the digital world, multiple paths bring your user to any given screen . For  the Product Detail screen, the user might see the product featured   on the homepage and click the link (Figure 18-8) .

One path to the Product Detail screen could begin on your site’s homepage



Alternative paths also bring users to the Product Detail screen . Perhaps the user searches for the product by name in an external search engine like Google or Yandex or Baidu . They see the product in the search results and click the link to arrive at the Product Detail screen (Figure 18-9) .

another path to the Product Detail screen could begin on an external search engine


To generate a list of possible previous steps, ask the team: “Where did the user come from? What path did they take to arrive at this screen?” Since you almost always have multiple entry points for a given screen, the team will generate several options . Write the options down on the canvas (Figure 18-10) .

Probe for paths from other sites and channels
Some teams are so focused on their product, they  overlook  external paths . Ask about paths from other channels . Did they see a URL on a billboard? Click a link in an email? Hear about your site from a friend?
Think about where the user is and how they get to the screen . If they’re in a store, they’re on a mobile phone . If they’re talking to a salesper-  son, they’re probably in an office on a desktop . Did they click a link? Scan a QR code? Type in a URL? How did they get to the screen you’re designing?


For brick-and-mortar retailers, it’s common for customers to search for information about a product they see in the store . If your organization’s sales force drives most purchases, maybe your customer types a URL they see on a brochure .

PRIORITIZE THE PREVIOUS STEPS
How do you identify what path to prioritize? Four questions help iden- tify the most important paths:
What path occurs most frequently?
If you design this screen to support users arriving on only one path, what would it be?
What previous step can you support that will create the most value for your organization?
What previous step can you support that will create the most value for your users?
Rank the previous steps from most to least  important .  Capture  the  most important previous step at the bottom left of the canvas .

FINISH AND SHIFT TO DISCUSS CONTENT
Now it’s time to talk about the screen’s content:

“Let’s talk about what content should appear on the screen.”
