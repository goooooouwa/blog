The difference between content and functionality
When you generate content, you want  to  know  about  text,  images,  and multimedia (like audio, video,  and  animation) .  Content’s  differ- ent from functionality .  Content is consumed .  Functionality lets users   to do something . During content generation, people will also call out functionality .
Content and functionality intertwine . For example, for the  Product  Detail screen, someone might suggest the user can download a tasting guide . The tasting guide is content . Downloading the tasting guide is functionality .
Try to separate content from functionality . Of course, to reinforce that you’re  listening, capture both content and functionality on the canvas .    If someone suggests downloading a tasting guide, capture  “tasting  guide” under content and “download tasting guide” in the functional-    ity column (Figure 18-12) .

When your team combines content and functionality, write both ideas on the 4-corners canvas


Probe for additional content
When 4-corners focuses on a single user and task, it helps the team cre- ate an interface targeted toward a single scenario . This advantage is also a disadvantage . Most screens support multiple users and scenarios .
Five questions help probe for additional content:
What other content would be useful?
What content will other users need?
How else could this screen be used?
What kinds of content do competitors offer?
What kinds of content appear in similar types of screens?
Refer to the user’s story: what other content will help the user complete their task? For our Product Detail screen, you would ask: “What other content will help our customer decide to buy this product?”
For the Product Detail screen, what other content helps the customer decide to buy this coffee? All kinds of things come to mind:
The region
The blend
Available formats like ground, unground, or K-cups
Ask about other ways the screen may be used . For example, will your customer refer to the Product Detail screen after they’ve purchased the coffee? Will other users use the screen to support other tasks?
For example, on many B2B sites, customers reference product informa- tion to locate product specs .

Steal from the best
Ask about content competitors use or content that appears in similar interfaces . What should you copy from your competitors? Buying a car is nothing like buying coffee, but maybe there’s something interesting about the content car dealers surface that makes your Product Detail screen more useful .


PROBE FOR CONTENT THAT’S OUT OF SCOPE
A project’s scope of work (SOW) refers to assumptions and agreements the team makes about what will and won’t work within the timeline and budget . The scope creates a shared vision for what the project will and won’t be . Even on projects with no specific scope, like an agile team, the team has an unspoken assumption about the project’s scope .
Although you can’t and won’t build everything, probe  past  assump- tions about scope . You’ll help the team identify content they think is out of scope but really isn’t .
It’s possible the team’s assumption is wrong . When I collaborate with teams, it’s not uncommon for a developer to know of additional, useful content hidden in an API or database somewhere . You never uncover these possibilities unless you probe beyond what the team  assumes is  in scope .

Focus on ideation, instead of scope
To probe beyond scope, focus the discussion on ideation . The question isn’t “what content that’s in scope would help the user with their task?” The question is “what content will help the user complete their task?”   At this stage, you want to generate ideas .
Product owners, developers, and project managers get  twitchy  when  you talk about anything that’s out of scope . “Out of scope” means missed deadlines, budget creep, and lots of late nights . Reassure the  team you’re looking for ideas and no one’s committed to delivering anything .

Out of scope identifies a roadmap
At worst, out-of-scope content can be added in later phases . Understanding what you may build later helps the team architect the product to accommodate future builds . It ensures you don’t build your- self into a corner that requires future rework .
