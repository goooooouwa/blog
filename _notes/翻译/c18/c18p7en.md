Scope may need to change
Probing helps teams check assumptions around scope . For a Product Detail screen, you may have agreed that ratings and reviews were out     of scope . When you probe beyond scope, you open the conversation to revisit some of these early assumptions .


Scope is like any rule . Rules are less about what to do and more about the consequences when they’re broken . Project scope is less a guideline for what to build and more about what needs to happen when you cross the line .
Perhaps for the Product Detail screen, the team decides rating and reviews are critical for the project’s success . With that realization,  the team learns it should renegotiate the scope to include ratings and reviews .
You may need to reassess what’s in scope . Maybe something gets bumped, so you can include ratings and reviews . Maybe the timeline  gets extended, more team members added, more money added to the budget . For now, ideating content that helps users doesn’t require diffi- cult conversations about timeline, budget, and features . However, ide- ation can surface difficult conversations the team should have .
Reassure team members that you haven’t committed to anything . Mark out-of-scope items when they’re captured . This can be as simple as an asterisk next to out-of-scope ideas (Figure 18-13) .

PRIORITIZE THE CONTENT
Once you’ve explored possible content, prioritize what’s most import-  ant . Identify what content is more and less important and write a num- ber next to each content item (Figure 18-14) .

Begin with the first prioritization question:
If we could deliver only one piece of content on this screen, what would it be?
Refer to the user’s story to help the team prioritize . If you have an idea for how content should be prioritized, number several of the most important content items . This offers the team something to react and respond to .
Use the other standard prioritization questions to help the team rank each content item:
What content will be used most frequently on this screen?
What content provides the most value for users on this screen?


In the age of responsive design, you can use the mobile screen to help prioritize:
In what order should content appear when viewed on a mobile phone?
The prioritized content list becomes a checklist for what  to  include  when you design the screen . The priority reveals the content’s layout .

FINISH AND SHIFT TO FUNCTIONALITY
After the team prioritizes the content, move on to talk about functionality:

“Now that we’ve nailed down the content, let’s talk about what func- tionality we should include on the screen.”

Activity 6: Identify Functionality
Content gives users information they need to complete their task . It’s  possible the user’s next step will be outside of your control . A user may use the Product Detail screen to decide to buy a  book,  and  buy  the book somewhere else . Functionality helps the user to  complete  their task within your experience .
In this last conversation, the team will generate and prioritize function- ality .  Focus the team on the user’s story and capture a prioritized list     of functionality .

THE FRAME


WHAT WILL YOU DO?
Discuss the functionality that the user needs to complete their task
WHAT’S THE OUTCOME?
a prioritized list of functionality
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
Identifies elements that need to be included
HOW WILL YOU DO IT?
List and prioritize the different functionality elements
To frame discussion around functionality, say:

“Now that we know what users are trying to do and what content they have, let’s identify the functionality, so we make sure the screen includes everything they need. Let’s list the different types of function- ality, and then prioritize them to understand what is most important.”


FACILITATE THE FUNCTIONALITY DISCUSSION
To open the conversation and generate functionality, include the user’s story in your question like you did for the content discussion:

When [the customer] arrives from [Google search results], what func- tionality do they need to [decide to buy], so they can move on to the [shopping cart]?

For the Product Detail screen, your story would sound like this:

When [the customer] arrives from [Google search results], what func- tionality do they need to [decide to buy], so they can move on to the [shopping cart]?

List any functionality the team generates to the right of the screen on the 4-corners canvas (Figure 18-15) .
