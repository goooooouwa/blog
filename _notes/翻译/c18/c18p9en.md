4-Corners for More Than Just Screens
4-corners is a method for thinking and making any kind of interface . While I’ve used screens as examples so far, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t use the 4-corners approach to think about the visible and invisible parts of an interface in other contexts .

CORNERS FOR AGILE USER STORIES
When you’re working on agile development teams with user stories, the 4-corners checklist helps the team think through how to imple- ment a user story . Like with wireframes, mockups, and prototypes, documenting the 4-corners along with the user story helps the team remember key decisions and context around how to implement the user story .


4-CORNERS FOR CROSS-CHANNEL DESIGN
Although the examples use screen-based interfaces,  the  4-corners method works for any kind of interface and any kind of touchpoint .     Use 4-corners when designing emails,  hardware,  augmented  reality,  and voice systems . The 4-corners provide a checklist for thinking about any kind of interface, not just screens .
Similarly, the previous and next step in your 4-corners don’t  need to      be in the same channel . The previous step could be an email, and the  next step could be a physical store . 4-corners helps you think about an interaction’s context regardless of the user’s current, previous, or next channel .

4-CORNERS FOR SERVICE DESIGN
The flexibility of 4-corners extends to service design as well . The pri- mary user becomes the actor and can apply to any front- or back-stage actor when designing a service . When mapping services, annotate each touchpoint with its 4-corners story to record the context around the ser- vice interaction .

4-Corners Creates a Shared, Holistic Vision of the Interface
We won’t cover how to sketch an interface here . How you sketch an interface varies based on the type of interface you want to sketch, styles and trends at the time, and the type of interactions you want to support . You know how to sketch . After working through the 4-corners, you’ve created a shared vision about what and why, and have improved the odds that the product will really do what you need it to do .
In the next chapter, we’ll look at a few ways you can apply 4-corners and sketching to bring teams together and generate lots of ideas .
