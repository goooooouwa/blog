Even though the team will generate several tasks, probe the team to think of other possibilities . Just like with users, probe with questions or statements:
A question: “What else might the user want to do on this screen?”
A statement: “The shopper may want to share  this  coffee  blend with a friend .”


Tasks that are too broad
To make sure a task isn’t  too broad, ask: Will the user accomplish  that task on this screen? Or will they complete the task across several screens?
On the Product Detail screen, you say the primary task is to buy the product, but the user can’t buy the product on the detail screen . You want the user to buy the product, so how does the Product Detail screen help them buy? In this case, the Product Detail screen helps users decide to buy the product .

Tasks that are too narrow
Some tasks support the primary task . For the Product Detail screen, users may want to see the price or tasting notes or evaluate ratings and reviews . These tasks help the user complete the primary task, to decide  to buy the coffee .
When you identify tasks that are too narrow, capture them under func- tionality to the right of the canvas . Talk about them more when you talk about functionality .

PRIORITIZE TASKS
There’s a trick to interaction design . If you design an interface to sup- port two tasks, neither task is as successful as if it was the only task you designed for . For every additional task you add to an interface, the over- all effectiveness of the design for each task goes down . When the team identifies the most important task, you learn what task to prioritize in the final design .
Rank tasks from most to least important . Use questions like the ones you used to choose the most important user:
What task will be completed most frequently on this screen?
If we could only design this screen for one task, what would it be?
What task can we not afford to mess up on this screen?
What task creates the most value for users on this screen?
What task creates the most value for the organization?


FINISH AND FOCUS ON WHERE THE INTERFACE LIVES IN THE USER’S JOURNEY
Note the primary task at the top right of the screen . With the primary users and tasks identified, the team knows why someone will use an interface . However, every interface leads to another, and you want to make sure the handoff is as smooth as possible .

“Now that we know the user and task, we want to make sure the inter- face supports their journey. Let’s look at where the user goes next.”

Activity 3: Identify the Next Step
You talk about the user’s next step, so you can design this interface to help the user get there . Reinforce how every interface leads to another, and your team will build better, more  useful  experiences  that  help  users get where they want to go .
To think about the user’s next step, the team will discuss and prioritize possible next steps and identify the most important one .

THE FRAME

WHAT WILL YOU DO?
Identify next steps
WHAT’S THE OUTCOME?
Identify the screen’s primary, most important next step
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
helps optimize the screen layout and design
HOW WILL YOU DO IT?
Identify and prioritize next steps and safety nets
To frame discussion around the next step, say:

“Let’s identify where the user will go next, so we make sure we opti- mize the screen the right way. first, let’s identify possible next steps, and then we’ll choose the most important one.”

FACILITATE DISCUSSION ABOUT NEXT STEPS
As you discuss the user’s next step, help your team explore all possible options . Ask your team: “What happens after the user completes their task on this screen? Where should the user go next?” Write next steps down on the canvas (Figure 18-6) . Reassure everyone that you’re listen- ing and including their perspective .


The primary task should make the next step obvious . If our Product Detail screen helps the user decide to buy the product, and they click “Add to cart,” what happens next? What do they see?

Every interface you design is just one step in the user’s journey

Probe for conflicting next steps
Sometimes your organization’s interest competes with the user’s inter-  est . Probe the team for conflicts between what you want the user to do and what the user wants to do:
What does the user want to do?
What does your organization want the user to do?
With the Product Detail screen, you may want the user to “Add to cart .” Meanwhile, the user may want to Google the product and buy it from someone who sells it for less . If you’re lucky, the organization and the user want the same next step . If not,  capture  these  conflicting  next steps on the canvas .
