Design Interfaces with 4-Corners

Four weeks into a website redesign, I ran a workshop that included both my team and the client . I asked each of the 15 participants to take two minutes and sketch a wireframe of the website’s homepage . When the timer went off, we collected all 15 sketches and taped them to the conference room’s beige walls .
Across the length of the conference room hung 15 different versions       of the website’s homepage . Common elements appeared in several sketches . Many included a large image at the top of the screen . For some, the large image was a carousel . Others featured lists of products  or news items . Some featured prominent links that spoke directly to different types of users .
After four weeks, why would 15 people on the same project have so many different visions of the homepage?
When anyone thinks about a screen, in their head, they picture content, functionality, and a layout . And they make assumptions about who will use the screen, why, where they came from, and where they’ll go next .
Even though wireframes seem like they are about screens, they really catch a snapshot from an entire scene . In my  workshop,  the partici- pants sketched 15 different versions of the homepage because each par- ticipant imagined a different invisible interface .
Good interfaces need thinking . The 4-corners method helps you think with your team or clients, so you can make better interfaces . Your team will start building better screens, and you’re going to help them .

How 4-Corners Works

FIGURE 18-1
first, identify the invisible parts of the interface. Then, identify the required contents and functionality. finally, sketch the interface.

corners helps teams think  about  the  visible  and  invisible  parts  of  an interface . 4-corners uses a canvas, so teams have a place to see the invisible parts of an interface before they work on the visible parts . 4-corners helps teams think about the  design  behind  the  design  with six activities:
Identify the user
Identify tasks
Identify next and previous steps
Generate list of content
Generate list of functionality
Sketch the screen
corners creates a visual checklist teams use to think about the visi-    ble and invisible parts of an interface (Figure 18-1) . When teams think about the user’s journey, they design better interfaces that create more value for both end users and the organization .
At the end of this activity, the team will have created:
One or more sketches of the interface
A description of the interface’s content and functionality


When you work through the 4-corners, the team agrees on the screen’s most important user, goal, and the previous and next steps, the invis- ible parts of the interface . The team also aligns on what content and functionality should appear, the visible parts of the interface .

WHEN TO SKETCH INTERFACES WITH 4-CORNERS
Use 4-corners any time you need to sketch or review an interface . I’ve used 4-corners with designers, developers, and clients to design suc- cessful screens for business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-con- sumer (B2C) websites and applications on all kinds of platforms .  It works anywhere, any time .

INPUTS AND QUICK STARTS
Before using 4-corners, the team should have a sense of the product’s users as well as a vision about the product’s end state .  This  shared vision about the users and the end state helps focus your 4-corners discussions . (Learn how to create a future state vision in Chapter 7 . We cover system users in Part III .)

MATERIALS YOU’LL USE

corners uses five lists to think about what to sketch.

To use 4-corners with your team, you need a way to visualize the 4-cor- ners canvas (Figure 18-2) . Use a pre-printed worksheet, or sketch the canvas on a whiteboard, flip chart, or piece of paper .

Users,  Tasks,  Previous/Next  Steps,  Content,  and   Functionality These may be edited or moved during discussion . Use sticky notes or write and erase, as there aren’t that many individual items .

Activity 1: Identify the Interface User
Every interface helps a user do something .  Identifying that user leads    to useful interfaces that create value for your organization and the end user . To think about the user, the team will:
identify people they think will use the interface
prioritize those users to identify the most important one
If there’s only one user, or you already know the most important user, skip this and jump to the next activity to talk about the user’s task .
