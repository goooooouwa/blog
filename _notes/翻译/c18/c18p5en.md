Activity 5: Identify Interface Content
Content is how you communicate with your users and help them reach their goal . Before you can design a screen, you need to know what con- tent should appear .
At the end of this discussion, your team will have listed and prioritized content to include in the design . To help the team focus content on user needs, use the 4-corners to describe the user’s story .


THE FRAME

WHAT WILL YOU DO?
Identify content the user needs to complete their task
WHAT’S THE OUTCOME?
a prioritized list of content

WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
Identifies elements that need to be included in the screen design
HOW WILL YOU DO IT?
List and prioritize the different content elements
To frame the content discussion, say:

“Now that we know what users are trying to do, let’s identify the con- tent, so we make sure the screen includes everything they need. Let’s list the different types of content, and then prioritize the content to understand what’s most important.”

FACILITATE CONTENT DISCUSSION WITH THE USER’S STORY
4-corners helps teams think about the invisible parts of an interface: the user, their task, and the previous and next steps . Without the 4-corners, you design screens by asking: what content do we need? By working the corners, the team frames the design as a story . The interface shifts from a single screen into a scene in the user’s journey .
For the Product Detail screen, the story might be: The user sees the product listed in Google, clicks the link to see the Product Detail screen where they decide to buy, and clicks “Add to cart .”
When you focus on the user’s story, you transform the team’s  think-    ing . Instead  of  designing  a  Product  Detail  screen,  the  team  designs a screen that helps users decide . The user’s story reflects the team’s shared vision of how the interface can be useful and successful .

Stories make vision easier to share
Stories knit together complex details into a self-contained, easy-to- understand package . It’s difficult to keep a list of requirements in your head and remember what requirements are important . Stories explain what details are most important and why .
When you communicate with stories instead of requirements, it’s eas- ier for your team to share the same vision . The story makes it easy to internalize and remember the user’s journey . This also makes stories easier to share with clients and other audiences .


Working with stories changes how the team thinks and talks about the interface . Instead of designing a Product Detail screen with a list of fea- tures, the team adopts a user-centered approach they’ll begin to use on every interface they produce .

Stories counteract design paralysis
Good collaboration includes everyone, generates more ideas, and pro- vides more perspective for evaluating those ideas . These broad perspec- tives include a wide range of reasons for why one idea is better or worse than another . In the book Switch, Dan and Chip Heath note our analyt- ical selves love to poke holes and debate ideas . The “‘analyzing’ phase is often more satisfying than the ‘doing’ phase, and that’s dangerous ”1
When you focus on the story, the team directs their energy to help the user complete the task . The story identifies an end goal, a destination .
For our Product Detail screen, the destination is no longer product information .  Now the destination is a decision  In the Heaths’ words,
when you focus on the user’s story, the team can sidestep analysis paralysis and navigate toward the destination .
With the user’s story in mind, the team has a frame for thinking about the visible interface, the content and functionality To open the discus-
sion, use the 4-corners to generate the user’s story:

When [the user] arrives from [previous step], what content do they need to [task], so they can move on to the [next step]?

For the Product Detail screen, your story would sound like this:

When [the customer] arrives from [Google search results], what con- tent do they need to [decide to buy], so they can move on to the [shop- ping cart]?

As the team lists content, write it down to the right of the 4-corners canvas (Figure 18-11) .

List content the user needs to the right of the canvas

For our Product Detail screen, the customer needs four pieces of infor- mation to decide to buy this coffee:
The coffee blend’s name
A picture of the coffee package
A description of the coffee
The coffee’s price
Because you’ve chosen the most important user and task and identified previous and next steps, the team can easily generate necessary and appropriate content .
