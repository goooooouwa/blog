THE FRAME

WHAT WILL YOU DO?
Identify primary users
WHAT’S THE OUTCOME?
The screen’s most important user
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
helps you optimize the screen for the most important user
HOW WILL YOU DO IT?
Work together to discuss the interface’s different users
To frame discussion around users, say:

“Let’s identify the screen’s most important user, so we make sure we optimize the screen the right way. first, let’s list the possible users, and then choose the most important one.”


FACILITATE DISCUSSION ABOUT POSSIBLE USERS
Talking about a screen’s users is as easy as asking the team, “who will use this screen?” As the team talks, write possible users on the 4-cor-  ners canvas where everyone can see them (Figure 18-3) .

List users at the top left of the canvas

When you feel the team missed a few users, probe with questions or statements . Open-ended questions help the  team  expand  their  think- ing . For example, you might ask,  “Are  there  other  users  who  might use this screen?” If you think the team overlooked a specific user, say something like, “Mobile workers might use this screen to pick a coffee shop .”


Users who work together
It’s also useful to think about how users work with others . We  designed a Product Detail screen for a furniture site . Research indicated online shoppers made purchase decisions with their family . Discuss with the team whether users share information with other users .

When you don’t know the user
If the team doesn’t know possible users, you’ve skipped an important  step . Pivot to discuss users (see Chapter 10) .

Prioritize multiple users
The end goal is to identify the most important user for this screen .  If   the team identifies only one user, then you’re done and can move on to the user’s task .
More likely, the team needs to prioritize a list of several users, so they can identify the most important ones . Rank users from most to least important (Figure 18-4) . If the team has trouble ranking, ask questions to help prioritize:
If we could only design this screen for one person, who would it be?
Who will use this screen most frequently?
What user cannot afford to fail on this screen?
What user creates the most value for the organization when they use this screen?
What user needs this screen the most?

Once the team agrees on the most important user, note the user at the top left of the screen and tell the team you’re ready to focus on what the user is trying to do .

But this screen is for all users!
It can be scary to choose one, most important user for a  screen .  Reassure clients and team members you won’t disregard other possible users . Often, an interface will have two important users . As long as you capture and prioritize both users in the list, you can design the inter-    face to support both of them .
During discussion, you captured all the possible users on the 4-corners canvas . This reassures everyone that you heard them . If the team can’t rank users from most to least important, try other prioritization tech- niques . Knowing the most important user helps you decide what con-  tent and functionality to include and how to organize the layout .


FINISH AND SHIFT TO DISCUSS THE USER’S TASK
The team assumes the users will use the interface to complete one or more tasks . Once the team has identified and prioritized the interface’s users, shift the discussion to clarify each user’s task .

“Based on the interface’s primary users, let’s identify the task they want to complete.”

Activity 2: Identify the User’s Task
When I ran that workshop where 15 participants sketched 15 differ- ent versions of the homepage, all 15 participants had slightly different ideas of what the homepage would help users do . Each design helped the user accomplish a slightly different set of tasks .
Every interface helps users do something . To think about  the  user’s task, the team will identify the tasks the users complete in the inter-    face and then prioritize those tasks to identify the most important one .
If there is only one task for this screen, or you already know the most important task, skip this and jump to the next part of the interface and talk about the user’s next step .

FACILITATE DISCUSSION ABOUT POSSIBLE TASKS
To generate a list of tasks, ask the team: “What tasks do users need to complete on this screen?” As the team lists tasks, write them on the canvas (Figure 18-5) .
