Focus on the primary next step
Help the team focus on the singular most important piece of function- ality . One piece of functionality will relate to the user’s most important task . For the Product Detail screen, if the user decides to buy the book, then they need an “Add to cart” button .
This principle is at work in applications and websites you use every day . There’s usually one piece of functionality that is more prominent than   all the others . Sometimes the most important piece of functionality is called the primary call to action .
If the team is unsure of where to start, refer back to any flows or jour- neys they’ve completed .

Probe for functionality related to each user task
Although you identified the user’s most important task, you also iden- tified additional tasks . Use the prioritized list of user tasks to probe for additional functionality . If the user wants to recommend a coffee, should the Product Detail screen include tools to share the coffee with other people?

Probe for functionality related to content
Each piece of content offers opportunities for additional functionality .
First, although the user may need to access each piece of content, that doesn’t mean they need to consume the content on this screen . The user may want to see a tasting guide . That doesn’t mean you display the tast- ing guide on the Product Detail screen . (But what if you did?) You can provide functionality that allows users to access content .
Second, functionality may enhance content . For example, perhaps the user would like to see a larger map of the growing region . You could offer functionality that allows the user to zoom in on a map or to view     a larger version of the map .
If you offer product reviews, you may offer ways to filter what reviews appear . Users could look at only the good reviews or view only one-star reviews .

Probe for out-of-scope functionality
Like with content, don’t limit discussion to what everyone assumes is in scope . Although you can’t and won’t build everything, probe past assumptions about scope to help the team identify functionality they think is out of scope but really isn’t . While you may end up with func- tionality that is out of scope, you’ll likely discover useful functionality you can implement that isn’t .

Probe for safety nets
There is no perfect design . Sometimes we fail our users . If a user comes to this screen and it’s not what they were expecting or doesn’t give them the content or functionality they need, how can you help them? How can you provide a safety net that catches these users and helps them on their way?
For the Product Detail screen, maybe they’re looking for a different ver- sion . Can you provide a link to whole bean or K-cups? Maybe this isn’t the coffee they want . Can you provide links to similar blends?

PRIORITIZE THE FUNCTIONALITY
After generating functionality, write a number next to each piece of functionality to represent what’s most and least  important  (Figure  18-16) . The most important functionality is the primary call to action .

To kickstart prioritization, ask:
If we could deliver only one piece of functionality on this screen, what would it be?
Refer to the user’s story to help the team prioritize . Use the standard prioritization questions to help prioritize functionality:
What functionality will be used most frequently on this screen?
What functionality provides the most value for users on this screen?
What functionality provides the most value for the organization?
With prioritization complete, you know what functionality needs to appear on the screen and what should be most prominent .

FINISH AND MOVE TO SKETCH THE INTERFACE
Now that the team has explored the invisible and visible parts of the interface, it’s time to start sketching .

4-Corners for Wireframes, Mockups, and Prototypes
Before you sit down to create wireframes, mockups, or prototypes, use 4-corners to think about the primary user and context and to prioritize content and functionality .
You can also use 4-corners to annotate wireframes, mockups, and pro- totypes with the story behind the interface (Figure 18-17) . Stitch the 4-corners information together to describe the scenario you used to create the screen . For the Product Detail screen, you might note:

“The customer wants to decide whether to buy this coffee. They see the coffee listed on the Product Search results and click the link to come to the Product Detail screen. If they decide to buy the coffee, the customer clicks the ‘add to cart’ button.”

Documenting a screen’s 4-corners helps the team remember the deci- sions they made when they created the screen .
