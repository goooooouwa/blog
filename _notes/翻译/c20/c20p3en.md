LEVEL OF FUNCTIONAL FIDELITY
EXAMPLE
functionality type (low)
add to cart
functionality format
“add to cart” button
actual or sample content (high)
Lightbox appears

LAYOUT FIDELITY
Layout fidelity describes how well your model demonstrates the inter- face’s layout (Figure 20-7) . Do you have a sketch with a general layout? Or are you looking at a mockup with exact spacing and positioning?

FIGURE 20-7
Layout fidelity refers to how accurately the layout appears in your interface model

Layout fidelity also works at three levels:
Prominence or priority
Relative position
Actual position
When you use 4-corners to prioritize a list of the Product Detail’s con- tent, you identify the importance of each element, or how prominently it should appear in the interface .
When you sketch the Product Detail screen with your team, you placed the content on the screen . Your layout describes how each piece of con- tent will appear relative to other content .


If instead you create a pixel-perfect mockup, you illustrate the actual position of each piece of content .

LEVEL OF LAYOUT FIDELITY
EXAMPLE
Prominence or priority (low)
Prioritized list of content
relative position
Sketch of content layout
actual position (high)
mockup of content layout

VISUAL FIDELITY
Visual fidelity describes how closely the interface model resembles the actual product (Figure 20-8) . Like all fidelity, the higher the visual fidel- ity, the easier it is for someone to understand . You can see this in action in your career: some clients just don’t “get it” when they see a wire- frame . They have to see a mockup .

FIGURE 20-8
Visual fidelity describes how closely the interface model resembles the actual product

Like content, functionality, and layout, visual fidelity also works at three levels:
Suggested visual design
Relative visual design
Actual visual design


If you describe the Product Detail screen in an email and mention it will include your logo, then you suggest the visual design .
If you make a wireframe and use the company logo and brand colors,  you use the relative visual design .
If you create a mockup and use the company typeface, colors, logo, and spacing, then you show the actual visual design .

LEVEL OF VISUAL FIDELITY
EXAMPLE
Suggested design (low)
Description to include the logo
relative design
Logo and brand colors
actual design (high)
Logo, colors, typeface, and spacing

Each of these visual fidelities provides answers to different questions about the visual design .

CONTEXTUAL FIDELITY
Contextual fidelity refers to the context where people will see and use  the interface (Figure 20-9) .
Let’s say you want to test the usability of a web application . Do you show users paper printouts of each screen? Or do you have them click through screens in a web browser?
If you show your interface model in the context where end users will actually interact with it, your interface model has more contextual fidel- ity than if you showed a bunch of printouts .




FIGURE 20-9
When you show an interface model to someone, how accurate is the context? are they looking at a mobile app on paper or on their smartphone?

You can describe contextual fidelity in three levels:
Suggested context
Relative context
Actual context
If you say customers will use the Product Detail screen in their web browser, then you have suggested the screen’s context . If you make a wireframe the same size of a web browser, then you illustrate the rel- ative context . If you show the Product Detail screen in an actual web browser, then you show the screen’s actual context . If you install a hard- ware prototype in a place similar to where it will live in the real world, then you’re displaying the device’s context .

LEVEL OF CONTEXTUAL FIDELITY
EXAMPLE
Suggested context (low)
Description of screen in a web browser
relative context
Product Detail wireframe with web browser dimensions
actual context (high)
Product Detail screen in an actual web browser

Contextual fidelity affects the types of questions you can ask about how an interface will be used .


Three Ways to Make Interface Models
The tools you use to make the model also control the fidelity of your interface model .
Text descriptions and sketches can be made by hand . You use software  to create wireframes and mockups . Prototypes and actual products require operable code that receives and responds to user interaction .

TOOLS YOU USE
MODELS YOU CAN MAKE
hands
Text descriptions and sketches
Software
Wireframes and mockups
Code
Prototypes and products

That doesn’t mean you can’t use software to write a text description       or sketch an interface . You can, but you can’t create a wireframe or mockup without software, and you can’t build a prototype or product without code .
