Choose the Right Interface Model: Wireframes, Comps, or Prototypes?

Until now, we’ve used sketches to make interface models . You make a model, so you can Check it . Another way to say that is: you make inter- face  models  to  answer  a  question .  And  since  sketching  helps  teams think  about  three  visible  parts  of  the  interface—the  content,  func- tionality, and layout—another way to say this is: you make sketches to answer questions about content, functionality, and layout .
A sketch is one type of interface model that lets you ask certain ques- tions, but it isn’t the only way . You can model interfaces five ways . To answer the right questions, choose the model that offers the right fidel-  ity to answer the right question .

Five Types of Interface Models (and the Actual Product)
Whenever you talk about an interface, you talk about either an actual interface, like the actual product, or an interface model, like a wire- frame . The actual product is always the actual product . However, you can model an interface in other ways . In all, you have six ways to Check an interface:
Text descriptions
Sketches
Wireframes
Mockups (or visual comps/compositions)
Prototypes
The actual product

Each interface model offers a different level of fidelity . Knowing how the five types of interface models compare to the actual product helps you choose what model to Think-Make-Check when you  collaborate with your client and team .

TEXT DESCRIPTIONS
Text descriptions are the fastest way to describe an interface .
Think about the best developer you’ve ever worked with . Now imagine you both want to build a Product Detail screen for your ecommerce site . Imagine you bump into your favorite developer in the hallway and talk about the new Product Detail screen . You talk about having the prod-  uct name, a description, and a product image . And of course, you talk about an “Add to cart” button .
With only that information, you know everything you need to design the interface, and the developer has everything they need to start cod- ing . For any interface, talking about the content and the functionality is the quickest, easiest way to describe the interface . In the case of the Product Detail screen, you and your developer friend walk away with two lists .
For content, you identified three items:
Product name
Product description
Product image
For functionality, you identified one item:
“Add to cart” button
Although a text description lets you describe the content and function- ality, you and your favorite developer each make assumptions about the visual design and the layout .


SKETCHES
With  a  text  description,  you  can  describe  content  and  functional-   ity . Sketches expand a text description’s content and functionality to include layout (Figure 20-1) .

Imagine the Product Detail screen you talked about with your favorite developer .  Step up to a gleaming whiteboard and draw the screen in  blue marker . Squiggles for text, a box with an X for the product image, and a rectangle for the “Add to cart” button . By sketching the screen, you’ve now discussed the content, functionality, and the layout .
Although a sketch offers more information, it’s only a general  idea  about the layout, and you still have to imagine the visual design .

WIREFRAMES
Wireframes add more detail than when you describe the  interface  (Figure 20-2) . In addition to content,  functionality,  and  general  lay- out, you start to replace unspoken assumptions about format with real specifics .

a wireframe adds content format and quantity to the functionality and layout

The additional detail in a wireframe reveals how much content can appear, the length and format of content strings, the size of images, and other details . Wireframes also include more accurate information about the layout and clearer detail about affordances for functionality . Is “Add to cart” a big button or a small button?

MOCKUPS
Mockups, or visual comps, show  what the actual product would look like  to the user (Figure 20-3) . The mockup isn’t the actual product, but it looks like the actual product . Mockups show a “comprehensive layout”1 that includes exact color, spacing, typography, and photo and illustration styles .

Usually, a mockup shows how the wireframe will appear in  its  final state . However, like the wireframe, the mockup only suggests screen behavior . You can’t see actually what happens when the user clicks on the “Add to cart” button .
