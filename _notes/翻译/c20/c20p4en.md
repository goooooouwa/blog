Different Models Support Different Interface Fidelity
To Think-Make-Check an interface with your team or your client, you work through two steps:
Know what question you want the audience to answer .
Show a model or actual interface that includes the information your audience needs to answer that question .
Different types of interface models support different types of fidelity at different levels (Table 20-1) .
TABLE 20-1. five types of interface fidelity at three levels

FIDELITY OF PROTOTYPES AND THE ACTUAL PRODUCT
Of all the ways you can Check an interface, prototypes and products display the highest possible fidelity and take the longest to produce . Prototypes and products also provide the greatest flexibility since they can also display fidelity at any range from low to high (Table 20-2) .
TABLE 20-2. Prototypes and products provide the maximum amount of fidelity (area shaded in orange) and take longer to produce

FIDELITY OF SKETCHES AND TEXT DESCRIPTIONS
Prototypes and products take much longer to create than other inter- face models . In contrast, you can create interface models like text descriptions and sketches by hand much more quickly than you can create prototypes or products . In exchange for that speed, your model has much less fidelity and you can answer a more limited set of ques- tions (Table 20-3) .
TABLE 20-3. Text descriptions and sketches provide low levels of fidelity (area shaded in green) in a short amount of time

FIDELITY OF WIREFRAMES AND MOCKUPS
Wireframes and mockups live in a sweet spot between how long they  take to create and how much fidelity they provide . Wireframes and mockups let you answer more questions and evaluate  more  assump- tions in less time . This flexibility and usefulness explain why wire- frames and mockups continue to be used despite periodic trends for prototypes or sketches (Table 20-4) .
TABLE 20-4. Wireframes and mockups provide almost as much fidelity (area shaded in blue) as prototypes and products in a fraction of the time

Use the Lowest Fidelity Possible to Reduce Iteration Time
With each type of model, trade how long it takes to create with what kind of question you can answer . To help the experience machine learn as quickly as possible, choose the model you can make in the least amount of time that answers your team’s specific question .
The interface model you choose must  include  the  information  you  need to Think-Make-Check . If you want to check content and function- ality, don’t spend a bunch of time creating a mockup . If you want to see if an animation makes sense, then a wireframe won’t do . You  have to  use a prototype .


When you choose how much fidelity to include, use the highest fidel-    ity for the question you want to check .  At the same time, use the low-  est fidelity possible for everything else . Optimizing fidelity makes the model quick to produce, so you can iterate quickly .
Also, if you show too much fidelity too soon, you can trigger disagree- ments that distract from the question at hand . If you want to check functionality, and someone gets hung up on color, you lose what they might have had to say about functionality .
So, it all comes down to the question you want to answer .
