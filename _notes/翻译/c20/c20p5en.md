QUESTIONS DIFFERENT INTERFACE MODELS CAN ANSWER
The question you want to answer drives the fidelity you need and the interface model you can use . Your team can evaluate an almost infinite number of questions about any given interface .
The following table of common questions (Table 20-5) can help you decide what interface model to choose . Although a list of questions is never complete, the table includes many common questions that face product teams . Select the question you want answered, and the color of the cell indicates the model that supports the fastest iteration time for that question: green for sketches and text descriptions, blue for wire- frames and mockups, and orange for prototypes and products .


TABLE 20-5. Different interface models can answer different types of product questions. Sketches and text answer many questions (area shaded in green) while other questions require wireframes or mockups (area in blue) or prototypes and products (area in orange)

Adjust Fidelity for Your Audience
Way  back in Chapter 2, we talked about how your audience and chan-  nel affect the fidelity of the models you make . Generally, the farther away the audience, the more fidelity you need to include in your model (Figure 20-10) .

FIGURE 20-10
The farther away your audience, the more fidelity you need to include in your interface model

Audiences that are farther away need more fidelity because they share less of the teamâ€™s vision . Your team shares more vision with itself than with the CEO because you and your team talk every day, while you com- municate with the CEO less frequently .
