SCREENSHOTS
Unlike the other types of interface models, a screenshot is an image of  the actual product, not a model of the interface . However, because it’s just an image, it provides the same kinds of information you see in a mockup . Screenshots show actual content, its format, fonts, color, and layout .
Although screenshots seem exactly like mockups, there’s one import-   ant difference . A mockup is a model of an interface . A screenshot is a picture of the actual interface .2

PROTOTYPES
Prototypes add real functionality . In addition to knowing the content, functionality, layout, and design for the screen, the prototype can show what happens when the user clicks the “Add to cart” button (Figure 20-4) . Does the user stay on the Product Detail screen and see a mes- sage that says the product was added to the cart? Does the user click through to another screen where they see their shopping cart?

On every project I’ve ever been on, a screenshot of the actual interface never looks exactly like the mockup that is a model of the interface . Funny thing, yeah?


THE ACTUAL PRODUCT
The actual product isn’t a model of the interface . It’s the actual inter- face . For the Product Detail screen, you see real content and the func- tionality really works . You see the Product Detail’s actual visual design, and you can look at the screen in a real web browser .
Each of these ways for discussing interfaces illustrates the interface at a different level of fidelity . These different fidelities let your team answer different questions .
How do you know what interface model to use? You choose the model that provides the right fidelity .

Five Kinds of Interface Fidelity
When you  design  interfaces  with  your  team  and  clients,  you  want  to have the right kinds of conversations about the  right  things .  The right fidelity maintains your team’s shared  vision .  The more  fidelity, the more you ensure the shared vision, but the longer it takes to Make something before you can Check it . Less fidelity and you iterate faster, but the team shares less vision .
Adjust the fidelity of your model in five ways:
Content fidelity
Functional fidelity
Layout fidelity
Visual fidelity
Contextual fidelity

CONTENT FIDELITY
When you create an interface model, content fidelity describes how accurate the content is . When you show a Product Detail sketch, do you have a squiggle for the Product Name? Did you write, “Product Name,” or did you write the name of a real product?
Visual designers often use “greeked text,” like “Lorem ipsum . . .,” in mockups . Greeked text has less content fidelity than real, sample con- tent (Figure 20-5) . When visual designers use greeked text, they want to see how well a typeface works in a visual design, and any letters will do .


What if you wanted to Check that your labels were clear? Can you eval- uate labels in an interface with greeked text? Probably not .

Content fidelity refers to how accurately content appears in your interface model






Content fidelity exists at three levels:
Content type
Content format
Actual or sample content
Let’s say you sketch a Product Detail screen with your team . If you scrawl “Product Name” at the top of the sketch, then you’ve identified  the type of content that will appear .
If you note the Product Name will be “text” that is no longer than 150
characters, then you have defined the content format .
If instead you wrote, “Guatemalan French Roast,” then you’ve used actual or sample content .

LEVEL OF CONTENT FIDELITY
EXAMPLE
Content type (low)
Product Name
Content format
Text, 150 characters max
actual or sample content (high)
Guatemalan french roast

The fidelity lets you Check different questions about the content . Do you want to ask about what content? The content format? Or make sure the interface works with real content?


FUNCTIONAL FIDELITY
Functional fidelity describes how well functionality works in your interface model (Figure 20-6) . Do links work? Or are they just blue text with underlines? You can gesticulate wildly to describe how something moves, or you can just show an animation .

Like content, functional fidelity works at three levels:
Functionality type
Functionality format
Actual or sample functionality
Let’s say you sketch a Product Detail screen with your team . If you scrawl “Add to cart,” then you’ve identified the type of functionality you want available .
If instead you make a wireframe and include a button that says, “Add to cart,” then you have defined the functionality’s format as a button . (You could have used a link instead .)
If you create a prototype that shows a lightbox appears when you click the “Add to cart” button, then you’ve illustrated the actual or sample functionality .
