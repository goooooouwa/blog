TACIT, IMPLICIT, AND EXPLICIT INFORMATION
As a rule of thumb, you can share interface models at low fidelity with yourself and your team . When you share with your organization, the models need to be at medium fidelity, and when you share with users, you should aim for high fidelity (Table 20-6) .

In practice, you can reduce the amount of fidelity you show a given audi- ence if the audience already has the information they need to answer     the question you want to ask .
Let’s say you want to ask if someone agrees with the content on the Product Detail screen . If that person is on your team, and you’ve worked through the 4-corners together, then they know what content you want to include . Let’s say you ask the CEO about the content . How would they know what content you wanted to include? When you adjust the fidelity for your audience, you make sure the CEO knows enough about the content on the Product Detail screen to agree or disagree with your design .
There are three kinds of information your audience may or may not have:
Tacit information
Information that is understood without being suggested

Implicit information
Information that is implied, though not stated

Explicit information
Information that is specifically stated

Explicit information
Explicit information is the easiest to understand because it’s anything  that is specifically stated .  If you see text on a screen that says, “View  my profile page,” the text is telling you exactly what happens when you click it (Figure 20-11) .


FIGURE 20-11
Explicit information is anything that’s clearly stated in the interface







Implicit information
Implicit information refers to anything your audience can figure out from looking at your interface model .  If you have a wireframe with  a drop-down, most people will know that when they select the drop- down, they’ll see a list of options to choose from .

Tacit information
Teams live off of tacit information . This is all of the things you and your team members know because you’ve been working together . Tacit understanding is about your team culture . When you see a magnify- ing glass next to a text input, you probably know that’s a search field . Nothing in the interface model tells you it’s a search field, and a mag- nifying glass by itself doesn’t say “search .”

You can check the content in your sketch with the CEO if they under- stand that the squiggle at the top is the product name and the lines are the product description . However, if they might not understand the squiggle and lines, then you need to make the interface more clear .
CLARIFY FIDELITY TO SET EXPECTATIONS
For an ecommerce website,  I  presented  a  wireframe  to  a  room  full  of C-level executives . The room got quiet, and then the CTO spoke . “This is terrible . The website can’t be all gray .” I wanted to check con- tent, functionality, and layout, and my audience wanted to check visual design .


Either spend more time to create interface models with more fidelity, or set expectations about what the model includes and—just as impor- tantly—what it doesn’t (Figure 20-12) . For the CTO, I should have clar- ified that I wanted him to Check the content, functionality, and layout and that the wireframe would not show the final visual design .

FIGURE 20-12
Set expectations to share tacit information with your audience so they can answer the question you want

When you set expectations, it creates a tacit understanding about the model that gives your audience the additional information they need to answer your question .

USE ANNOTATION TO OFFSET LOW FIDELITY
You can provide more information about an interface without improv-  ing fidelity . Annotations provide explicit information without any changes to a model . If you want to ask the CEO about the content on your Product Detail sketch, and you’re  worried she won’t  know what  the squiggle is, you can add an annotation that says, “Product Name .”


Annotations can add explicit information to any part of a model . Annotate content, functionality, layout, visual design, or context . Designers pack wireframe specifications with annotations to describe information you’d only otherwise see in a prototype or actual product (Figure 20-13) .

FIGURE 20-13
Wireframe specs use annotation to describe functionality that would not otherwise be clear without a prototype or the actual product

SET EXPECTATIONS AND USE ANNOTATIONS TO CONQUER DISTANCE, TIME, AND REACH
Set expectations and add annotation to counter the effects of distance, time, and reach . Team members separated by distance and time will never have the same tacit understanding as colocated team members, so set expectations and add annotations to collaborate better .
Add clarifying notes to your interface model to reduce misunderstand- ings and unnecessary churn that slows iteration . Ultimately, it’s your responsibility to make sure your audience understands what they’re looking at and has the information they need to answer your question .
As always, balance your need for speed with your need to communicate clearly .  Get the balance right,3  and you’ll help your team learn more  and faster,4  and your experience machine will release better products .
