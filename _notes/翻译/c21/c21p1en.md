Checks

The Check seems like it lives at the end, but it’s really just the begin- ning . The Check lets you and your team evaluate your thinking and making, so that you can do more and better thinking and making . This part examines the Check in Think-Make-Check and how to structure and facilitate checks with teammates, coworkers, and clients, so that you can generate good, useful feedback to fold into your Think-Make- Check process .

Checks (and Balances)

I left this chapter for last . I almost didn’t finish it . I spent all my time and energy thinking and making the rest of the book, and now I don’t have the proper amount of time to give this chapter its due .
How ironic that this mirrors real life . You spend your time thinking about stuff and making stuff and spend much less time checking stuff .
If you survey the literature—or even flip through this book—the bulk     of the job is thinking about stuff and making stuff . But remember the model: Think-Make-Check (Figure  21-1) .  Check  is  just  as  important as Think and Make . And the model is a cycle . You Think so you know what to Make . You Make so have something to Check . You Check so you get feedback to Think about . Think-Make-Check creates a virtu- ous cycle where Check provides fuel to Think about and Make better things .

FIGURE 21-1
Think-make-Check create a virtuous cycle where each iteration teaches you more
and more about the product and its users
Thinking and making vary more than checking . How you Think about users differs from how you Think about interactions . How you Make interactions differs from how you Make interfaces . In contrast, you always Check everything the same way . Checks follow the same pat- tern regardless of what you want to Check .
In this chapter, you’ll learn how to receive and manage feedback, how to handle jerks, and most importantly, how to think about Checks, so you and your team learn about your product and its users more and


faster . You’ll also learn how Frame-Facilitate-Finish structures your Checks, so you answer the questions you need to answer and receive    the right feedback at the right time .

Checks Start with the Finish
Every collaborative activity works through the same three stages: Frame-Facilitate-Finish . Checks follow this same pattern, and to plan your Check, you want to begin with the end in mind and start with the finish . So, to plan a good Check, you need to identify the question you want the audience to answer . What’s the question?
Often, teams request feedback on something they’ve made . That’s the common scenario when you say Think-Make-Check .  However,  there are lots of other things you can Check .

CHECK EACH STEP IN THINK-MAKE-CHECK
Think-Make-Check suggests you Check the model you Make . That is, you Think about users, Make a user model, and then Check that model with your team .  Yet  Think-Make-Check hides opportunities for teams  to collaborate more closely with each other and others . You  can Check  at every step . Check after you Think, Check after you Make, and Check after you Check (Figure 21-2) .

FIGURE 21-2
You can Check at every step of the Think-make- Check process




You can Check after each step of the Think-Make-Check model because each step has its own inputs and outputs (Table 21-1) . Before you can Think, you need observations, something to think about . You Think about them to create analysis . You use the analysis about the user, interaction, or interface to Make the model, and you Check the model     to gather observations (Figure 21-3) .

This process plays out when you design an interface . You Think about your observations about users and their needs . Your analysis suggests a certain kind of interface . You can Check that analysis, or you can Make the interface . So, you open your favorite software and create a screen . You want to Check that screen with your users, but before you do, you can Check it with your team to make sure everyone is on board .
