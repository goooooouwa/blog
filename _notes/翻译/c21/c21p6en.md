IGNORE JERKS
Every once in a while, you meet someone who doesn’t understand basic human decency . Maybe they missed breakfast . Maybe someone sucked out their soul and crushed their heart and kicked them in the shin . The reason doesn’t really matter . They act like a jerk and there’s no excuse .
First, don’t cringe or flinch . When someone provides feedback in the rudest way possible, lean in . Remember, you are not the work, and this  is about how much the team can learn .  There’s nothing to fear .  The  jerk leads with bluster . Ask questions to see what’s behind the bluster .
If you disagree, ask why until you identify the root cause behind the feedback . If you disagree with the root cause, find some way to discuss that disagreement .  If you agree with root cause, then find a solution   you both agree on . When you agree, explicitly state you agree, clearly collect the feedback, and clarify how you’ll make the change .


Most importantly, don’t respond in kind . Jerks excel at hurting your feelings, even when you’ve  separated yourself from the work .  That’s  the definition of a jerk . Even though they hurt your feelings, stay calm, compose yourself, and lean into the bluster to find the learning that’s hiding there .
Most people are so put off by jerks, they never learn anything . Imagine the moral victory when you help the team learn in even the worst circumstances .

Stick the Finish
So far in the Check, you’ve carefully framed the feedback you want, carefully discussed the feedback, and clearly collected the feedback . In the Finish, restate everything one more  time .  Summarize  the  Check and explain what happens next .
To summarize the Check, repeat what you reviewed, restate the ques-  tion or questions you discussed, and reiterate the feedback the team collected . By quickly reviewing everything that just happened, you reinforce what everyone discussed, that everyone participated, and that everyone agreed to the feedback . The review makes the collaboration explicit, concrete, and real .
Second, if anyone disagrees with any of the feedback or your recollec- tion of events, the finish provides one more opportunity for them to speak up and provide additional perspective .
After summarizing the Check, share what happens next . What will you do with the feedback? How will they know how you applied the feed- back? Explain how you will use the feedback, and when and if they can see any outcomes, the next version, or what it turns into .
And to really stick the finish, type the review and the next steps and  email everyone after the meeting .  The follow-up  email  is  the  cherry on top .

Keep the Faith
In “The Emperor’s New Clothes,” a line manager hires two consultants  to design a great new  wearable  product .  When  the  manager  demos the product to other managers in the organization, everyone laughs . Clearly, the consultants delivered vaporware  and  the  engagement wasted time and money .



When you Check analysis, models, and ideas with your team, some- times you’re the emperor in the fancy new clothes, and sometimes you’re the peasants laughing at them . The Check is the important step where you see if everyone else can see the same awesome that you can see . With my teams, I do what I call “crazy checks” where I show some- thing rough and kind of out there to see if I’m onto something or if I’m crazy . Sometimes I’m onto something, and sometimes I’m crazy .
And sometimes, I’m  one of those tailors sewing something awesome   that no one else can see yet . Sometimes, your team, or the organization, or your customers just won’t get it . Regardless of how much you try to explain the vision, sometimes you won’t get any traction . When this happens, keep the faith .
Have faith in your idea and keep it around for  another  day  when it might make more sense .  Or keep the faith in the Check and abandon   the idea that the team dismisses . Regardless of where you land, keep  faith in Think-Make-Check . Every turn through the process turns the gears on the experience machine . Every  turn reveals  new  opportuni- ties to improve the product, your team’s process, and how your organi- zation delivers experiences . Turn by turn through Think-Make-Check, your organization will build better products, and you’re going to help them do it .
