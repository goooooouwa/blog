Repeat the feedback back to the participant
When you understand the feedback, repeat it back to the provider, so they can verify that you understand it correctly . For example, after working through why the name should change, you might repeat the feedback as: “Change the name to something less generic, so the per- sona seems more real .”

Collect feedback visibly
If you want the team to invest the time in providing feedback, collect feedback in a way that’s visible, so they can see clearly that you’re lis- tening . This can take the form of visible notes or making edits in real time while the team watches .
For in-person Checks, write feedback on a whiteboard or easel  pad  where everyone can see . For remote Checks, you can swap your screen- share from the item being checked to a document where you type feed- back, so everyone can see the collected feedback .


Collect the feedback in the same way you repeat it back to the participants .

Affirm and repeat feedback when you agree
When someone says something you don’t agree with or don’t under- stand, repeat it back and ask a question to understand . When someone says something you do agree with, make sure you say so . If you don’t take the time to tell them you agree before you talk about something else, they will think you don’t agree or don’t understand and keep giv- ing you the same feedback . They want to make sure you’re listening .
You can’t just say, “yes .” In my experience, “yes” doesn’t communicate that you heard the feedback and you agree . You need to be more explicit and say something like, “yes, I agree .” You can’t say, “yes, I agree” to everything without sounding robotic, so you should vary a bit . You’ve likely heard other people use these common variations:
Yes, I agree
I agree 100%
That is a really good point
I’m totally with you on that
We’re on the same page
Let me “plus one” that
When you explicitly indicate your agreement, it reassures the speaker that you agree, and when you restate the feedback, it shows you under- stand what they said .

Affirm and extend when you almost agree
Sometimes you almost agree with someone . In those cases, focus on where you agree and try to  extend  the  discussion  to  address  where you disagree . The easiest way to affirm and extend is the phrase, “yes, and…” This affirms what the speaker said and lets you extend the dis- cussion to explore an area where you don’t agree .


As with, “yes, I agree,” there are several useful variations you can use to affirm and extend:
Yes, and let’s explore that more
Yes, and let’s dive in a little deeper
Yes,  and let’s double-click into that
When you want to affirm and extend, phrase the request as a statement instead of a question . A question invites others to stop the conversation exactly when you want to dive in a little deeper .

No buts
These strategies rely on affirmation to cement trust between team members . In keeping with our focus on affirmation,  avoid  the  word “but .” “But” signals disagreement, the opposite of affirmation . Instead  of saying “but,” create the habit of saying “yes, and” or “and,” or if you must be contrary, just start a new sentence . Never say “but .”

Talk to everyone in the Check
Good collaboration includes everyone, so make sure you ask each par- ticipant for feedback during the Check . The shared discussion should raise any and all issues the team has with the item being checked . Toward the end of the Check, ask the room if there is any other feed- back or anything missed .
If anyone has been too quiet, ask them directly .  If someone’s  buried     in their laptop, address them by name . You want explicit assent from everyone in the room that you’ve discussed all feedback for now . Verbal alignment now will reduce churn later .
Reassure everyone that this isn’t the last word and explain how to pro- vide additional feedback they identify later . Usually, this is direction to send you an email or submit an issue .

Table discussion when it’s not productive
Anytime a Check stops being  productive,  table  further discussion, so you can correct the issue and reconvene when you can use every- one’s time wisely . Three chief causes discussion may not be productive include:


You don’t have the people or perspective you need
What you want to Check is not what the audience expected
What you want to Check is obviously wrong
If the right people didn’t attend the Check, end as quickly as possible   and reschedule for another time . Continuing without the  people  you need wastes time . Ending the meeting so you can reschedule respects everyone else’s time .
