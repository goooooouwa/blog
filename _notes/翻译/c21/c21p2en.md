CHECK WHAT YOU DID AND HOW YOU DID IT
Each step of the Think-Make-Check process creates its own output, and you can Check that output before you move to the next step . You don’t need to check every step of the Think-Make-Check process, but when you need to, you can .
To make it more convoluted, you can Check two things for each of those outputs . First, you can Check what you did . Second, you can check how you did it . Imagine a math problem . You have the problem, you show your work, and write the answer .  Of course, you can Check whether   you have the right answer, and you can also check whether you used the right method to get to the answer (Table 21-2) .


TABLE 21-2. The Think-make-Check cycle and Checks for the outputs from each stage



THINK

CHECK
Outputs
analysis for a model
a model to check
Observations to think about
Check what you did
Is the analysis right?
Is the model right?
are the observations right?
Check how you did it
Did we do the right kind of analysis?
Did we make the right kind of model?
Did we check the right model with the right people?

It turns out there’s a whole lot you can Check, from the most critical outcomes of the team’s work to the most minor or trivial ideas .
So, zoom out for a moment . The important takeaway: Check as often as is possible and useful with yourself, your team, your organization, and your users . And you don’t have to Check just the user, interaction, or interface model . You can Check the inputs or the outputs for any step .
Identify what you want to Check, so you know what you want the Check to finish with, and then it’s time to frame the Check, so your audience  has the context they need to give you the feedback you need .

Frame the Check
For a Check, the Frame works the same as it does any other time we collaborate . For each Check, answer the four questions:
What are we doing?
Why are we doing it?
How will we do it?
Why is it important?
So, if you wanted to Check a user journey with your team, you might frame it this way:

WHAT WILL YOU DO?
Check a user model
WHAT’S THE OUTCOME?
a list of changes to make to the model

WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
Ensures the team is aligned around a single vision of the user
HOW WILL YOU DO IT?
review key user attributes


If you wanted to frame a Check of a user model, you might say:

“Let’s review the persona to make sure we agree on how we’ve described the user. We’ll review key user attributes and collect any feedback and changes.”

When you frame the Check in this way, your audience understands what they’re doing, why it’s important, and what the outcome will be . However, people who Check things need some additional context . They may not be familiar with how you got to where you are . Checks invite two additional questions:
Where are we in the process?
How did we get to where we are?

WHERE ARE WE IN THE PROCESS?
Participants want to know where you are in the process, so they under- stand both what they’re looking at as well as what kind of feedback to provide . When you tell participants where you are in the process, you help explain why you want the feedback . Are you at the beginning of the process and reviewing something rough and unfinished? Or are you at the end of the process and reviewing something that’s about to be shipped to five million customers?
When participants understand where you are in the process, they can adjust between more directional feedback and more specific feedback .    If you’re about to launch a new app, you don’t want feedback on whether to include core functionality . You’re looking for feedback on fit and fin- ish . In contrast, if you show early sketches, critiques on spelling and layout are useless, while discussion around core concepts offers  real value .

HOW DID YOU GET WHERE YOU ARE?
If you don’t tell participants where you are  in  the  process,  much  of their feedback may be around who you’ve talked to and what activities you’ve done . For example, when you show your persona, participants might say to go do user research . If you haven’t done any research,  that’s good feedback . But if you’re showing a persona, you’ve probably already addressed the idea of user research .


Save yourself some back and forth during the Check and tell partic- ipants how you got to where you are . Explain the steps you’ve gone through to get to where you are .  Who did you talk to? What did you   do? What inputs did you use? What background information have you reviewed? Who else has seen this material? What have you taken into account? Or what have you not considered and why?
When you provide this additional context to your participants, you answer common questions ahead of time and help make the most of your time with your participants and increase the likelihood you will receive the feedback you’re looking for .
