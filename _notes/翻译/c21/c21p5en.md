You also want to reschedule if you have the wrong thing to Check . For example, if you wanted to Check high-level functionality in sketches and your team expected to Check layout and content in wireframes, you may want to end the meeting and reschedule . If you still want to Check something in the sketches, continue . However, if the team trusts you at that level and is ready to Check something with higher fidelity, end early and reschedule for when you have the right thing to Check .
Similarly, when you have the right thing but it’s wrong,  you  should table the discussion and reschedule .  For  example, let’s say you want     to Check a user profile built from survey data . At the beginning of the meeting, you learn the survey data isn’t any good . It’s no use to con- tinue to Check a bad profile . It’s probably wrong . Stop the Check and come back after you’ve adjusted .
In each case, you want to be respectful of your team’s time . Checks are an important part of collaboration, but respect, especially of people’s time, is foundational . When the  Check  stops  being  productive,  stop the Check .

Transform Feedback into Gold
Checks feel scary because your team might disagree with you . They might think you’re wrong, that your analysis is bad, that your idea is no good . Negative feedback can feel like rejection . But on a collaborative team, it’s no longer about you . On a collaborative team, feedback is all about learning . With modern products, there is no done, there’s always another version, the team is always just working through another itera- tion, and the team only moves forward when it learns new things about  its users or the product .


On collaborative teams, on modern teams, the Check is always about    the team . When you think about the Check, don’t think about  “me,” think about “we .”

MOVE FROM “ME” TO “WE”
In “Teaching Smart People How to  Learn,”1  Chris Argyris introduces the concept of a “defensive learner .” Argyris argues that many people approach feedback from the perspective of a defensive learner . When defensive learners receive feedback, they respond with four strategies:
To remain in control
To maximize “winning” and minimize “losing”
To suppress negative feelings
To define clear objectives and evaluate whether or not they achieved those objectives
Defensive learners spend more effort avoiding the embarrassment or threat of being wrong or feeling incompetent than the effort they spend on learning . As Argyris explains, “defensive reasoning encourages individuals to keep private the premises, inferences, and conclusions that shape their behavior and to avoid testing them in a truly indepen- dent, objective fashion .”
If you or your teammates approach the product process from a defen- sive position, you will learn less because you Check less . You’re less likely to Check underlying assumptions that drive your decisions and analysis .
In contrast, move from defensive learning to collaborative learning . Collaborative learners don’t think of themselves as owners of decisions and ideas . In contrast, they share control and ownership of ideas and decisions with the entire team . Rather than looking to “win” discus- sions or beat everyone else’s ideas, collaborative learners focus on how the team can learn more, faster . Instead of trying to avoid negative feed- back, collaborative learners trust their team’s good intentions and don’t take criticism as personal attacks (Table 21-3) .

Instead of thinking about yourself, focus on the team . What ideas can the team Check? What can the team learn? What questions does the team need to answer?

Trust your team

SEPARATE YOURSELF FROM THE WORK
You are not your work . The feedback isn’t about you . When you sepa- rate yourself from the work, you take the biggest step away from defen- sive learning and toward collaborative learning . If the work reflects you, then more negative feedback risks more embarrassment and rejection . If the work represents the team, then feedback helps you and the team learn, and the more feedback you generate, the more the team learns .
In many ways, when you move toward collaborative learning, you remove the risk of failure . Every hypothesis, idea, and design becomes one more test on the way to the perfect  product .  Don’t  fear  being wrong or failing . As long as you learn, you’ve successfully tested the hypothesis .
