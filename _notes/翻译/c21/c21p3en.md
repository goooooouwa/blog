INFORMAL CHECKS CAN USE VERBAL FRAMING
A Check shouldn’t need to be a formal affair .  Checks should be easy,   so you do them all the time, out of habit, reflexively whenever you have the opportunity . If a team member comes by, grab them to Check what- ever you’re working on . In these situations, frame the Check verbally .
Provide the complete frame: what do you want them to do, what’s the outcome, why is it important, and how will you do it? Then share addi- tional context around where you are in the process and how you got   there before collecting feedback .

FORMAL CHECKS NEED SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION
For formal reviews, document the Check’s framing and context, so you can share it with participants before they see what you want to Check . In common scenarios, you share the frame and context as slides in a presentation . For example, if you review an early draft of a persona, you might share the frame in two slides:
One slide with the frame (Figure 21-4)
One slide with where you are in the process and how you got there (Figure 21-5)



FIGURE 21-4
You can share the frame for a formal Check in a single presentation slide


FIGURE 21-5
Where you are in the process and how you got there will fit on one slide

Those two slides give the audience and participants the context they need to give you good feedback . If you share material asynchronously, share the frame, context, and the material for the Check as part of a single package .

MAKE IT EASY TO PREPARE FOR CHECKS
Even though teams focus on the  thinking and  making, the  Check  is  just as important and requires intentional preparation . However, it’s tough to make sure your team prepares if  the  preparation  takes  too  long or is too difficult . Make preparation easy . A good Check is the difference between a waste of time and a successful iteration through Think-Make-Check .


Add the frame and context slides to the beginning of your presentation template .  If you share long-form documents, add pages for the frame  and context at the beginning of the document .

Facilitate the Check
After you have properly framed the check and provided additional con- text, it’s time to facilitate the Check . Show the thing you want to Check and restate the question you want to answer . In our  example,  you’d show the persona .
Don’t forget to restate the question . If you show a persona, people can comment on the attribute groups, the individual attributes, the attri- bute values, the design, the persona’s name, imagery, layout, color, or typography . What do you want participants to comment on? If you want them to comment on the attributes and their values, then restate the question, so they remember:

“On this persona, did we communicate the right attributes to help the team design the product?”

After you restate the question, dive into the thing you want to check . Describe it, show it, demo it, whatever . Dive in .
Some teams may want some additional information . Feel free to pro- vide more background . For example, if you’re showing a model, talk about the analysis that led you to the model . If you show observations collected from another Check (like a usability test), talk  about  the  model you used for the Check . If you’re reviewing analysis, talk about the observations that formed the basis .
And then restate the question . And keep restating the question . There’s  a lot to talk about and a lot of things you can get feedback on . Continue to focus the discussion on the question at hand, so you make sure to get the feedback you need .


CAPTURE FEEDBACK
Collecting feedback is about more than just writing down a  list  of  things to change or taking notes . Good feedback collection demon- strates good collaborative behavior, so you want  to  demonstrate  that you trust everyone’s feedback and include everyone .

Ask questions, especially when you disagree
When someone offers feedback, ask question to clarify what they mean . Clarifying questions help you understand exactly how the feed- back applies and demonstrates that you’re listening and trust the par- ticipants’ feedback enough to really engage with and understand it . For example, if someone suggests changing the name when reviewing the persona, ask why . What’s wrong with the current name? What are you trying to achieve by changing the name? Your goal is to understand the why behind the feedback .
Most important, never say you disagree unless you’ve probed to under- stand the why behind the feedback . Most likely, you will agree with the why, so you can work toward a shared understanding about what should change . If, after you discuss the why, you disagree, then you have the opportunity to help get both parties on the same page or to agree to disagree .
