Affordances
Sometimes, designers refer to functionality as an affordance . Design thinker Don Norman described affordances as “properties that  deter- mine just how a thing could be used .”1
Functionality isn’t limited to how you intend an interface to be used . Functionality is however someone might use it . A wooden spoon is also Hermione’s wand (Figure 17-8) .2

Norman now recommends referring to “signifiers” instead of affordances when you create a design . In terms of an object’s properties, we still talk about affordances . See:
Norman, Don . “Signifiers, Not Affordances .” Jnd .org,17 Nov . 2008, jnd .org/signifiers_not_ affordances/ .

LAYOUT
Layout describes how the interface is organized . On their home screen, Google centered search in the middle of the screen and pushed sec- ondary functions to the edges (Figure 17-9) . Amazon nested icons, the speaker, and buttons on top of the Echo Dot and wrapped branding around the sides (Figure 17-10) .

DESIGN
Design is how the interface appears . Although Google and Bing both help users search the web, their home screens look different  (Figure 17-11) . Shop for spoons, and you enter a universe of spoon designs (Figure 17-12) .

Form versus function
The cliché “form follows  function”  suggests  a  designer  should  link  an object’s design to its functionality . This is an opinion about how to make good design . But form and function have nothing to do with one another .
The designer chooses the form . Functionality emerges from both the designer’s intent and the user’s imagination . The designer controls the form . The designer and the user share control of the function .

The Invisible Parts of an Interface
When anyone imagines a screen, they picture content, functionality, layout, and design, the visible parts of an interface . However, they also make assumptions about who will use the screen, why, what happened previously, and what will happen next, the invisible parts of an inter- face . Even though you draft a wireframe of a screen, that wireframe catches a snapshot from an entire scene .


Every interface has four hidden parts (Figure 17-13):
The user
The task the user wants to complete
The previous step
The next step

FIGURE 17-13
an interface has four invisible parts: the user, their goal, the previous step, and the next step.

THE USER
When you and your team talk about an interface, you imagine a user . Even if you haven’t talked about the user, everyone imagines a user .   You can’t think about functionality unless you imagine someone who uses it .  The affordances you build into an interface must be usable by  the user .3 Hands hold spoons . Fingers poke buttons .

THE USER’S GOAL
An interface assumes someone will use it to complete a goal . When you design an interface, you help the user reach that goal . You build the interface for a reason .

THE PREVIOUS STEP
For any interface, your user did something or looked at something before they saw your interface . When your team talks about a single screen, they make assumptions about what happened just before . Your team imagines an entire scene .

THE NEXT STEP
Just like you imagine the previous step when you think about an inter- face, you also imagine the next step . You imagine what happens after the user picks up the spoon or pokes the Search button .
Whenever you discuss an actual interface or a model of an interface, the interface’s visible and invisible parts come into play . To design an inter- face, you design the visible and the invisible interface .

The Invisible Parts of the Interface Are Most Important
While teams focus on the visible parts of the interface, the most import- ant parts are invisible . As you work on interfaces, you need a way to keep the invisible, visible, so your team makes the right decisions .  In  the next chapter, we’ll look at a way to think about the visible and invis- ible parts of an interface .
