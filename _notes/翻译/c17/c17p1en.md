Interfaces

As an experience machine, your organization produces experiences for both employees and customers (Figure V-1) . To have these experi- ences, employees and customers engage with interfaces . The interface enables, facilitates, and drives these experiences .

FIGURE V-1
Your organization is a user experience factory. Ideas go in, everybody does their part, and interfaces comes out that create experiences for employees and customers

Because they drive the experience, projects require a lot of time and work to be spent on the interface . Whether you want to design a wire- frame, get the frontend CSS to work, or look at analytics to see how users behave, teams focus on interfaces . Screens are a concrete thing everyone can point to .
This part explores the parts of an interface, the different types of inter- faces, and how to control interface fidelity, so you can Think-Make- Check interfaces with your teams and clients .


To help your organization create better experiences, change how your teammates think about and make interfaces .  You  work better together  to create better user experiences . Ideas go in, everyone does their part, and better interfaces comes out .

The Visible and Invisible Parts of an Interface

For any system, ask yourself: “How does the end user interact with the product?” Do they call in? Send an email? Browse a website? Mail in a form? Talk with an associate?
When you ask how an end user interacts with your product, the answer   is an interface . The interface is the one  object  many  organizations  think about more than any other . Interfaces are concrete, the last bit of the experience that the experience machine controls . But interfaces are  so much more .
In this chapter, we’ll learn about the visible and invisible parts of the interface . When you focus on the visible elements of an interface, like  the screen, it’s easy to overlook the invisible elements, the scene . Every interface screen is just one step in an overall scene, one step in the    user’s journey (Figure 17-1) .

ACTUAL INTERFACES
You can talk about the actual interface, or a model of the interface .
When you browse a website and notice hard-to-use widgets and unclear instructions, you’re Checking the actual interface . Analytics measure how customers interact with the actual interface (Figure 17-2) .

INTERFACE MODELS
Each design profession focuses on a different kind of interface . Architects design buildings . Interior designers design rooms . Service designers create services . User interface designers craft screens . Regardless of your design flavor, when you Think-Make-Check  a  design, you probably review a picture of some kind of interface . You don’t look at the actual interface . You review a model of the interface .
When we talk about interface models, we could talk about buildings, emails, chats, phone trees, scripts, websites, applications, cars, or any- thing, really . For this book, most examples will reference screens for digital products and services .

The Four Visible Parts of an Interface
Whether you’re talking about at an actual interface or an interface model, you probably talk about one of the four, visible parts of an interface:
Content, what the interface communicates to you
Functionality, what the interface lets you do
Layout, how the interface is organized
Design, how the interface appears

CONTENT
Content covers anything the interface explicitly communicates to  the user . Content does not include what a user might infer from the inter- face .  On a website, content includes text and images (Figure 17-3) .  In    a movie, content includes text, images, and sound (Figure 17-4) . For  hardware like Amazon’s Echo Dot, content includes the Amazon logo, icons, and what Alexa says (Figure 17-5) . A wooden spoon has no con- tent (Figure 17-6) .

FUNCTIONALITY
Functionality is what an interface lets you do . The Google home screen lets you enter a search query and press Search (Figure 17-7) .
