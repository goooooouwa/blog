USE BINARIES TO CONTRAST TWO ATTRIBUTES
Binaries display two attributes at opposite ends of a single continuum (Figure 13-7) . Like lists, binaries show an attribute exists . Unlike lists, binaries display a value for each attribute .


FIGURE 13-7
Binaries display two attributes as opposite ends of a single continuum




Because binaries show two attributes on one continuum, they require   less space than other ways to communicate attributes . If you use the  right attributes, binaries can be easier to understand . For example, you might communicate items used at the dinner table and place forks and spoons at opposite ends of a continuum . It makes sense that if you use forks more, you use spoons less, and vice versa .
Binaries are easy to understand when they  compare  attributes  that  make sense as opposites . This opposition, whether implied or actual,  illustrates a clear distinction between  two  attributes .  Use  binaries  when you want to suggest a user is more one attribute than another .
Binaries work best when attributes make sense as opposites . What if instead of forks and spoons, you created a binary with forks and plates? Even if research suggested it was true—if you use your fork more, you use your plate less—it doesn’t make sense on a continuum . Since user models should clearly communicate when team members and stake- holders look at them, create binaries with attributes that make sense  as opposites .
Binaries can hide the values behind user attributes . Let’s say you show temperature with warm at one end of the continuum and cool on the  other . Because warm and cool really do represent opposite values, you haven’t hidden any information . What if you created a continuum with warm at one end and comfortable at the other (Figure 13-8)? Is it true  that as I get warmer, I become less comfortable? Sometimes . How you measure warm is different from how you measure comfort, so placing them on a single continuum distorts and hides the values behind each . Sometimes this is OK . Sometimes it’s not .

USE INDIVIDUAL VALUES TO COMPARE AND CONTRAST MORE USER DATA IN LESS SPACE
Values display information about a single attribute (Figure 13-9) .

FIGURE 13-9
Values display information about each individual attribute














When you display values for individual attributes, it’s like you take a binary, break it in half, and display both attributes, each with its own value . Because you display each attribute with its own value, this approach requires more space than either lists or binaries .
Similarly, when you show values for every attribute, you show more information, so it’s harder to understand at a glance . However, because you show values for every attribute, the individual values communicate user data and assumptions in the most accurate way . Where binaries contrast two attributes against each other, individual values show sev- eral attributes side-by-side for easy comparison and contrast .


The attribute grid in Chapter 12 shows a value for every attribute for every user . The attribute grid allows teams to visually compare and con- trast attributes using color to visualize values as a DNA strip . You can also show value using numbers, length, or size (Figure 13-10) .

CHOOSE THE BEST WAY TO COMMUNICATE ATTRIBUTES
Choosing what attributes to communicate is pretty easy . Figuring the  best way to communicate them is harder . Whether you choose a list, binaries, or individual values, each method has advantages and disad- vantages (Table 13-2) . The best way to display user attributes is the one that helps you communicate what you need with the least amount of effort .

Communicate User Identity with Names and Images
The user’s identity is the most important part of the user model . You’d think attributes are more important, but without the ability to refer to a user, the team has no way to reference their attributes .
Identity performs two jobs . First, it identifies  each  user  and  makes them memorable . Second, memorable identities help teams better remember users and help user models spread throughout the broader organization .
Communicate user identity with names, visuals, or both .
