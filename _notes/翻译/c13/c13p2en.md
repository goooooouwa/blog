RATIONALE
What to build?
GUIDELINES
How to build?
GOALS
Why is the user trying to do this?

TASKS
What capabilities do users need?
What content and function- ality should we build?



CONTEXT
When and where do users need to engage?
how do we build content and functionality to make it usable in the appropriate contexts?


INFLUENCERS
What outcomes and preferences influence user behavior?
how do we build to increase adoption and engagement?

User models that provide rationale help teams understand user research and user needs, so they identify worthwhile problems and worthwhile ideas for how to solve those problems . User models that offer guidelines help teams decide what content and functionality to build, determine how to make it usable, and improve adoption and engagement .


The different types of information your team needs when they’re in innovation or implementation will change the type of user model you create .

User Models Come in Three Formats
Along with the type of information the model should include, the for- mat will change based on how the team uses the model . User models appear in three common formats:
References remind people about a user
One-sheets document a single user
Side-by-sides compare and contrast multiple users

REFERENCES
The design process references users in many places .  When you show     a wireframe and mention that you designed the screen for a specific   user, you’re making a reference . You note the user when you illustrate touchpoints, and you identify the target user when you design an inter- face (Figure 13-3) . In both cases, you don’t include a complete user model . Instead, you remind the audience about the user .

FIGURE 13-3
We use references to remind teams how to check something we’ve made (gibbon photo by Eric kilby, on flickr).

Though a user reference seems insignificant,  references  provide  crit- ical information the team needs to check whatever we’ve made . User references must provide enough information for the team to recall the user and relevant attributes . In the Think-Make-Check process, user references provide the critical information teams need to check .


ONE-SHEETS
When you think of a persona, you probably think of a one-sheet . One- sheets document one specific user  with an  in-depth,  detailed  view  of all relevant attributes (Figure 13-4) . During thinking and making, one- sheets give team members rationale or guidelines, so they can answer their innovation or implementation questions .

FIGURE 13-4
One-sheets document a single user to help team members during thinking and making (gibbon photo by Eric kilby, on flickr).

One-sheets carry a dual responsibility . They tell viewers what’s import- ant as well as provide further detail when viewers need to dive in .

SIDE-BY-SIDES
To understand how different user models compare to one another, dis- play them side-by-side (Figure 13-5) . Side-by-sides communicate more information than a reference and  less  information  than  a  one-sheet  and explain how users are similar or different .
Teams use side-by-sides to help choose what user to think about . Side- by-sides can also identify each user’s unique guidelines, so teams can evaluate their work .

Three Ways to Communicate User Attributes
Whether you make one-sheets, side-by-sides, or references, user mod-   els communicate user attributes .  You  communicate  user  attributes  three ways:
Lists
Binary values
Individual values

USE LISTS WHEN YOU DON’T NEED OR KNOW VALUES
Sometimes, you don’t  need to communicate how much of something .    If you only need to communicate that something exists, use  a  list  (Figure 13-6) .


FIGURE 13-6
You can communicate attribute values using a simple list











For example, you might want to tell team members what devices users have: a Galaxy S8, X-Box, iPad, BluRay player, and so on . You don’t need to explain how much Xbox, just that the user has one . You also use lists when you don’t know how much of something .

Positive lists
A list of user devices demonstrates a positive list . It  lists things that  exist or things to do or things to consider . Positive lists handle the majority of what you need a list to do .

Negative lists
We almost always imagine lists as positive, a list of things that exist or things to do or things to consider .  You  can also create lists of things   that don’t exist or things to avoid . For example, you might list devices users don’t have: an Apple Watch, Google Home, and an Apple TV . Sometimes it’s more helpful to think about what doesn’t exist or things  to avoid .
