Grids trade the column’s whitespace for grid lines, so you can squeeze more info into less space

Squeezing makes grids harder to read, something to  decipher  rather  than glance at . However, grids, like any side-by-side format, allow the team to see and compare multiple user models . Although columns and grids squeeze several user models into one screen or page, space limits how much information you can include . To communicate more infor- mation about a user, create a one-sheet .


TITLE THE SIDE-BY-SIDE WITH THE DOCUMENT’S PURPOSE
Give the side-by-side a title that explains why someone should look at  the document .  Are these the five user models the product will target?    Is this a collection of design guidelines for each of the user models? A selection of research highlights?
As a general practice, align the side-by-side with one of the two types  of user models (page 201) or one of the four questions user  models answer (page 200) .

MARK EACH COLUMN OR ROW WITH THE USER’S IDENTITY
Based on audience and need, head each column or row with the user’s identity .  Use good names and visuals to differentiate each user from    the others and to communicate who they are . Don’t hesitate to change names or visuals based on the audience or your goal . Better communi- cation beats better consistency, every time .

CHOOSE CONTENT THAT MATCHES THE DOCUMENT GOAL
Because of space limitations, side-by-sides only include two to three chunks of content . Choose the content that best fulfills your goal .
Don’t worry about running out of space . To show more information, create another side-by-side . For example, you might start with a single side-by-side to show user goals, needs, and design guidelines,  titled “User needs and design guidelines .”
While creating that side-by-side, you decide you want to include infor- mation about user context and journey . Context and journey won’t fit onto the first page, so create two side-by-sides . Goals, needs, and jour- ney fit together under the new title, “User goals and needs,” and context and design guidelines work well together under a new title, “Design guidelines .”

CUSTOMIZE CONTENT DISPLAY
For each content group, customize the display  to  communicate  best . Use lists, binaries, individual values, data visualizations, and text to get the point across . Each content group should answer the question posed  by the title .


Focus on a Single User with One-Sheets
When you have more information than fits in a  side-by-side,  or  you need to share more detailed information about a user, create an easy-to- consume, single page—the one-sheet . Use one-sheets to present  user data and attributes or to detail design guidelines for a specific user (Figure 13-18) .

FOCUS ON RESEARCH OR GUIDELINES, NOT BOTH
In the past, I combined research findings  and  attributes  alongside  design guidelines on the same one-sheet . However, I think this was an error . Any audience who wants research findings wants to know what they should build . And anyone who wants design guidelines wants to know how to build . Rarely do they want to know what to build and how to build at the same time . If the same person wants to see both, give  them multiple documents .

IDENTIFY USERS WITH MULTIPLE NAMES AND IMAGES
One-sheets offer more room for more information . Expand names and imagery to identify each user . A name, role, quote, headshot, icon, con- text image, and color ensure no matter who sees the one-sheet, they’ll know what user it refers to .


MAKE THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION MOST PROMINENT
Most website homepages share a similar structure . A large hero item rules the top of the screen, while three to four content blocks lurk  beneath . Posters, brochures, and PowerPoint slides share this layout because it highlights the most important information  first  and  pro-  vides access to supplemental information next .
Use the same pattern to lay out the one-sheet . Identify the most  important group of attributes or most important group of guidelines . Highlight and place this content prominently in the design .
What information is more or less important will depend on your team and organization . Like any prioritization, ask yourself, what is the one thing they need to know to be successful? Or, what one thing must they know to avoid failure? Every project, team, and organization has that one thing .

INCLUDE SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Use the rest of the one-sheet to communicate three to four additional pieces of information . Of all the information you have for each user, the supplemental information should include the next most important things the team needs to know .
