ILLUSTRATE USER RELATIONSHIPS
In some cases, product success depends less on individual users  and more on groups . In many business contexts, one person chooses the product, another approves the choice, and someone else  writes  the  check . Families can follow similar patterns for expensive home goods like cars, furniture, or appliances . One  adult  recommends  options  while another vetoes or approves .
Illustrate relationships as attributes or diagram the user’s network to make relationships clear (Figure 13-12) . Is it enough to know who the user talks to or works with? Or does the team need to see how the var- ious users are connected?

SHOW USER’S PLACE IN THE USER LIFECYCLE
If you segment users by where they exist on the user lifecycle, it can      be useful to illustrate how a user model relates to other users (Figure 13-13) . You might have models for potential users, new users, estab- lished users, and lapsed users .

SHOW USER’S LOCATION IN THE PRODUCT LIFECYCLE
Some products move through a lifecycle that touches multiple users, so you can map when and where the user interacts with the product   or process . For example, you could reveal when different users interact with a bag of coffee . Service blueprints show how several employees interact with a service and its user (Figure 13-14) .

ADD METRICS TO USER MODELS
Add existing metrics to user models to help the team better understand each user . For example, if you segmented users by prospective users, recent users, and returning users, you probably have analytics for each group . You might know the percentage of total visitors in a user group, average screens per visit, or average cart size .  Add metrics to tie the  user model to real data .

Show Multiple Users Side-by-Side
When we think of personas and user models, we imagine a single page with a headshot, snappy quote, and abstract charts that tell us about a single user . The one-sheet—because it condenses a single persona to “one sheet” of paper—is the most used and least useful format to docu- ment and share user models . If the product has more than one type of user, the one-sheet isn’t as useful as a side-by-side .
For projects with more than one user model, teams need to understand how those users compare to each other . When you document several user models side-by-side, your team sees how product decisions help or hinder different users . Your team can see the impact of its product decisions .
Show user models side-by-side in two ways:
Columns communicate less information, good for guidelines or research overviews
Grids communicate more information, good for research details
Choose the best format to leverage the advantages you need for your  team . Side-by-sides should be easy to scan, so team members quickly understand the information presented and find the  information  they  need .  Clearly mark each user’s identity and break columns and rows  into discrete chunks of information .


USE COLUMNS TO SHARE DESIGN GUIDELINES AND RESEARCH OVERVIEWS
Place multiple models next to each other in columns or rows to provide teams with an overview of important users (Figure 13-15) . List import- ant design targets or highlight users you will not design for .
When I review user models with stakeholders, I often show a list of users we will design for and a separate list of other users we identify as non-targets . Knowing who you’re not designing for is just as useful as knowing who you will design for .

Use columns to list users and provide an overview of who they are (photos by Eric kilby and Jeremy Couture, on flickr).

The column format can communicate guidelines on how to build  (Figure 13-16) . For each user, provide brief goals, content, and inter- action tips . You might note a user always uses their mobile, whereas small children constantly interrupt another user . Choose small details  that provide outsized information to help the team build more useful products .

Columns also work well to share high-level design guidelines (photos by Eric kilby and Jeremy Couture, on flickr).

Column layouts, loose and friendly, communicate less information by design . If you need to show more information, use a grid .

USE GRIDS TO SHARE DETAILED RESEARCH AND GUIDELINES
Like column layouts, grids set several user models side-by-side on one page or screen . However, where column layouts use whitespace to sep- arate information, grids abandon whitespace in favor of grid lines, so   you can squeeze more information into less space (Figure 13-17) .
