Document and Share User Models

A team shared a persona with a client . After listening to the presenta- tion, the client asks, “Why do we need this? What does this do for us?” The persona, though informative, failed to share anything useful .
User models are the TL;DR of user research . Also called personas, pro- files, or archetypes, user models transform a wall of sticky notes or endless attribute grid into a simple format that team members under- stand, so they can build products that users need and love .
Most user models document information like pain points, needs, and goals (Figure 13-1) . Once documented, what do you do with that  information? Well, that depends on where you are in the process . Put another way, what  the team needs to do changes how you should document your user model .

User models condense a broad variety of information about a user into something your team can understand at a glance .  The best user mod-   els communicate the point in less space—like a brief or infographic . Unfortunately, most teams don’t include people who  can  write  briefs and design infographics . To make good user models, you have to learn how to write briefs and create infographics .
You won’t learn how to write briefs or create infographics here . However, you will learn enough to put together the right user information in the right format . Your team will create more user-centered products, and your user models will help them do it .
To do this, we’ll look at the ingredients that go into a user model, the different ways your teams may use them, and the different ways you can communicate various types of information .

User Models Answer Four Different Questions
Different initiatives and projects ask different questions  about  their  users (Figure 13-2) . Broadly, think about projects as innovation or implementation .

at different stages, teams ask different questions about their users


QUESTIONS FOR INNOVATION PROJECTS
Innovation project teams don’t  know what the solution should be, yet .  So they can’t answer implementation questions . In fact, innovation proj- ects may not even know what problem they want to solve . Innovation teams have two big questions:
What problem or needs do users have? What can we make better for users?
What ways can we solve those problems? What solutions can we pursue for our users?
Projects focused on innovation typically shift into implementation  as they identify solutions to implement .

QUESTIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION PROJECTS
During implementation, teams take a solution from idea to product with two different questions:
How should we build the solution? What design will help our users?
Did we build it right? Does the solution do what we thought it would for our users?
With user models, tailor the information you include to match the questions your team needs to answer .

Two Types of User Models:
Rationales and Guidelines
If you think about projects as implementation or innovation, you can create two kinds of user models:
User models that reveal how you should innovate
User models that tell you how you should implement

MODELS THAT REVEAL RATIONALES FOR INNOVATION
During innovation phases, teams need help to understand what  prob- lems users have and a way to generate possible solutions . Innovation teams need models that communicate user needs, pain points, goals, contexts, and influencers .


During innovation phases, teams need models that provide  the  rationale for what to build . If a user model shows users need to understand where a coffee shop is located, that need gives the team a reason to solve that problem .

MODELS THAT PROVIDE GUIDELINES FOR IMPLEMENTATION
In implementation, instead of rationale, teams need guidelines for how   to build the solution .  Instead of needs, pain points, and goals, teams  need guidelines for how to design the interface and communicate mes- sages . Rationale tells the team that users need a way to locate stores . Guidelines tell the team to make store locators mobile-friendly because users view them on their phone .

COMPARING RATIONALE AND GUIDELINES
So far, we’ve split user attributes into tasks, contexts, influencers, and goals . Those four types of user attributes look different when you show rationales or guidelines (Table 13-1) .
