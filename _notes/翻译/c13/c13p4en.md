IDENTIFY USER MODELS WITH GOOD NAMES
When teams hear the user’s name, they should remember the  user’s tasks, contexts, influencers, and goals .
For a long time, user models had real names like John Smith or Zhang Wei . Designers believed personas with real names helped developers imagine the persona as a real person and build products that better  met their needs . Unfortunately, it’s hard to get to know a piece of paper, and a name like Zhang Wei or John Smith doesn’t communicate user needs very well .
An actual name can communicate user needs if you add a title like “Zhang Wei, HR Manager” or “John Smith, Subscriber .” Sometimes a title or role helps teams recall the user’s needs .
I’ve seen user models given alliterative names to make them more memorable like “Sam, the subscriber” or even “Sam Subscriber .” The name helps the model sound more real, so  the  team  will  empathize with and talk about what Sam needs and wants .
Although real names humanize user models, real names also attach human histories and biases . Who’s more likely to watch professional sports? Sam Subscriber or Samantha Subscriber? Who’s more likely to quit their job to raise the kids?


All names invoke stereotypes and biases . Sometimes you want team members to remember a user is male or from Asia . In contrast, if ste- reotypes about Asian men cause the team to make bad, less optimal decisions, then ditch the real name and use a title . Instead of “Sam Subscriber,” name the user model “Subscriber .”
When you choose how to name the user model, determine what the team needs more or less of (Table 13-3) . Does the team need more empathy for users? Do stereotypes improve or hamper how well they understand user attributes?

IDENTIFY USER MODELS WITH GOOD VISUALS
User models often include a photograph of a person to make the model seem more real . Like with names, actual photographs evoke stereotypes .
To counter negative effects of user photographs, use illustrations that remove the bias . The right illustration can hide age, gender, and ethnic- ity to control what stereotypes the model will trigger .
Stereotypical images aren’t necessarily bad . On one project, one seg- ment of users lived and worked in China, where their behavior differed widely from US users . The team frequently based decisions on assump- tions about US behavior . To counter this, we gave the Chinese  user model a photographic headshot . Seeing a different ethnicity reminded  the team to stop and think about how behavior in China and the United States was similar and different .


Of course, neither  headshots  nor  illustrations  communicate  much about user attributes . To improve the amount of information the visual communicates, use icons that hint at roles and behaviors .
Visuals can also communicate user context .  Instead of a headshot, use    a photo of a representative user in the physical location . For example, instead of a photo portrait, show a photo of a barista behind an espresso machine . Like icons, broader images hint at what the user does and where, while also giving the user model a more relatable visual .
Like with names, choose the image for your user model that best sup- ports the team’s needs (Table 13-4) .

Change Names and Visuals Based on the Audience
There’s no rule that you have to communicate user models the same    way to everyone . Change how you refer to users based on your audience (Figure 13-11) . For example, for executive presentations, you might use photos with context to provide more information . And for your team,  you might use an icon because they’ve internalized more of the infor- mation . Every time you refer to a user, communication with your audi- ence is more important than consistency .

Five Other Things to Include in User Models
Don’t limit user models to lists of attributes . Include any additional details that provide the team with information they can use to make product decisions .
