CUSTOMIZE CONTENT DISPLAY
Like with side-by-sides, customize the display to best communicate the content . Use lists, binaries, individual values, data visualizations, and  text to get the point across .

Share User Models in Other Ways
One-sheets and side-by-sides come from a time when one group researched and segmented user  models  into  documents  to  hand  over to another group . Of course, you would never work this way, in silos,  like some heathen .
Teams use user models three ways:
Teams refer to user models when they discuss interfaces and  journeys .
They ingest them to determine what to build .
They reference user models to make decisions about how to build  the product .


You can accomplish these goals and share user models in ways other  than one-sheets and side-by-sides .

STICKERS TO MAKE REFERENCES EASY
With teams that do a lot of sketching on paper, stickers make it easy to reference users on a sketch . Sketching interfaces? Paper prototyping? Identify the primary user with a sticker . Print stickers with sheets of adhesive labels .

POSTERS KEEP USER MODELS IN PLAIN SIGHT
If the team works co-located with one another, trade one-sheets and side-by-sides for posters . Layout and content follow the same princi-  ples as their smaller brethren . There’s more room, and you can make things bigger . Always-visible models allow teams to glance up  and check design guidelines or research finding while they work .

CARDS CREATE POCKET REFERENCES
The opposite of posters, cards make user models portable and easy to reference . Think of them like baseball or Pokémon cards, except  the team references user stats and design guidelines .

ONLINE HOMES MAKE USER MODELS AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE
Though online tools won’t fit in pockets, team members can access them from anywhere at any time . If your team uses online tools like Jira or Azure DevOps to manage user stories and track tasks, publish user models to the same system for easy reference .
If you can’t publish user models in the same system, add them to  other developer documentation or publish them where everyone has access—like an online document repository or design tool like Mural or InVision .
Where is less important than how easy it is for your team to remember, link to, and view its users . Bonus points if team members can edit and update the models . Nothing is immutable . As the team’s understand- ing changes, the team should update how that understanding is cap- tured in your user models .


SLIDE DECK TEMPLATES INCLUDE USERS IN EVERY REVIEW
Jessica Harllee recommends including the user models as part of your slide deck templates . That way, as you get ready for a review, the user models are already included and ready to set the stage for the review .

Make User Models in the Format You Will Review Them
Without a doubt, anyone can find something more valuable to do than busywork, so limit your busywork . Make user models in the same  format you’ll use when you check them with the team or other stake- holders . It’s no accident that one-sheets and side-by-sides look like PowerPoint slides .
That doesn’t mean you should shy away from other methods . There’s no reason why you can’t check posters, wikis, or other formats . My teams review user attribute grids with stakeholders . If teams can check user models in monster spreadsheets, then other formats will work, too .
Your goal is to review the model you make, not make a model, and then make another version to review . That doesn’t mean there’s no addi- tional work when you Check a user model, but limit additional work as much as possible and create user models in the same format you will review and use them .

User Models Are Powerful Reference Tools
Pretty personas seem so straightforward . In  truth,  they  culminate  a long string of critical decisions about who will consume the informa-  tion and why they need it . Answer those questions the right way and document the appropriate user models to create useful, powerful tools your team and organization can reference again and again when they make product decisions .
Now that you have condensed user attributes and analysis into easy- to-scan and -read documents, it’s time to put them into practice and understand each user’s journey .
