# Data object management

Data object management involves object life-cycle and object graph management, including persistence.

Data object management should not be specifically tied to any persistence solution.( This is why Rails bring Active Model to decouple Data object related stuff out of Active Record.)

ORM is used for mapping data object to rational database, so that data object can be saved using database. Itâ€™s for data object persistence.
