There’re basically two kinds of tasks to manage: small things to forget
important things to track

A small task list with:
auto delay
Fast enter task and date
No need to look back

For important things:

A planning tool (gantt?): to make a plan (roadmap/timeline).

A task management tool with:
stages
Subtasks
Time tracking
Progress


# Project management tool

Tasks 
Projects
* Task view (milestones & progress)
* Timeline view ()
* Project Wiki

Schedule


I wanna
Plan (roadmap, timeline)
Quick add task (to backlog)
Upcoming tasks (today, week, month)
Current progress (percentage, milestones)

我的困扰是如何计划任务，而不是如何管理定义好的任务（这个很简单）。

Problems with life & career as projects:
They’re endless, no clear end date
Life Tasks are often trivial and loose related, making managing it seemly pointless

Projects have to have clear scope and end date

# Findings when looking for a project management tool:

- All just task manager (maybe that's what we need for project management)
- Start date is almost a Premium-Only feature on all project management tools (except Zenkit).
- Gantt Graph is a Premium-Only feature on all project management tools. Have to find standalone Gantt tools.
