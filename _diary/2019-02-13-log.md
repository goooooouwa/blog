todo: 整理notes、职业、生活计划、writings、知识

1. Markdown editor for iOS which has access to git repo 

     Tried out:

     - Working copy

          Con: push is premium feature

     - Clone

          Con: push is in-app-purchase

     - GitHawk

          Con: read-only

     Solution: store a git copy in iCloud Drive

1. Look at hypothesis roadmap

     You may find that you need to click the "Log in" button each time the client loads, but as long as you are signed in to the website you won't have to re-enter your login details each time.

[https://github.com/hypothesis/product-backlog/issues/45](https://github.com/hypothesis/product-backlog/issues/45)

     login every time is considered valid. :(

     Not able to move annotations to another group once set. Not found in roadmap.

1. Found 2 useful Siri shortcuts for iA writer: <[https://ia.net/writer/blog/write-to-organize](https://ia.net/writer/blog/write-to-organize)>

     Navigating iA writer library and file list: Ctrl-Tab

     iA writer is too serious, distract me from pure content to format? (This is why I’m not using it as note-taking. But is iA writer a distraction for quick note-taking? Or is writing several lines of text note-taking, or writing?)

     What if iA writer can easily delete files.

1. 讯飞输入法据说不错，不过我试用后发现竟然不如Siri听写识别率高。

1. 做了自我分析。

1. Reported a bug to iPhone team. Delete locked file without warning.

1. Shortcut to certain folder. No direct keyborad shortcut. Use Spotlight, or cmd+shift+g

1. Siri shortcuts accept parameters: 文本听写action
