I’m not good with hardware engineering or electronics, just basic understanding.

I’m not even that good with writing code (I’m tired that in order to implement some function, one needs to write so many pieces of code to make it work, too many irrelevant details).

I only care about computer & software features.

Ideally single person computer & software projects.
