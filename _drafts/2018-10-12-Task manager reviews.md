## Zenkit review

### Pros
- I like its flexibility ( custom fields, switching views)
- You donâ€™t need to set assangee


### Cons
- No today view
- Buggy iOS app
- Slaggy Performance
- poor Chinese print pdf

Is suitable for big tasks which takes longer than a day.
With checklist grouping subtasks.

Good task management

Free plan limited (no report, no start time)
Teams not needed
