<p>Besides ensuring the successful production release of Digital API, I also have a habit of consistently improving our process and ways of working, including:</p>

  <li>Continuiously improve our backlog by elimilating the use of sub-tasks to manage different aspects of story ticket, which greatly reduced our number of tickets in backlog (from 180 tickets to 40)</li>

  <li>Helped team aligning on many conventions, like API naming and time format standardization, which serves as a framework for our future API design</li>
  <li>Actively communicate with both API team and client teams, weekly catchup with key roles, to make sure requirements gets understood and delivered exactly as our clients expected, which greatly reduce the number of requirements redo.</li>
