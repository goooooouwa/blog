<p>The short answer is that if what you mean by ‚Äúparameters‚Äù is form fields, then you simply can‚Äôt do this (at least not in a straightforward way that I can see). You should instead use a form with a submit button, styled to look like a link (if that‚Äôs what you want it to look like).</p>

<p>If on the other hand you had meant <em>query</em> parameters, then this would work:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">link_to "Profile", profile_path(@profile.id, param1: 'value1', param2: 'value2'), method: :post</code></p>
