	<div>By slow, we mean longer than one second.</div>
	
	<div><br/></div>DB is service over network, Elasticsearch is service over network. By nature, web applications talk with services over network, a lot.
	
	<div>So why talking to DB is fast (and Elasticsearch is reasonablely fast, too), but talking to, say, Active.com API is slow (10min to login a user)?</div>
	
	<div>1. Active.com API is slow</div>
	
	<div>2. We're calling it too many times in one requestÂ </div>
	
	<div>So the take away here is don't call more then twice services over network in one request.</div>
