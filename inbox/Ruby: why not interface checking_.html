Active record has a model relation:&nbsp;&nbsp;Polymorphic Association. It's kind of like Interface in Java, or Protocol in Objective-C. I was wondering why it doesn't have the same interface/protocol compatability check like the other two languages.
<div>It turns out( not 100% sure) it's because Ruby has no compilation, so no compatability check at compilation time. So even if we add the checking in code, it won't raise exception until run time, which is basically the same as method not found exception when no checking.</div><div><br/></div><div>So it's pointless to check interface compatibility in dynamic language like Ruby.</div></body></html>
