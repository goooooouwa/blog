Applies both for single document interface (SDI) and multiple document interface (MDI) programs. Also applies for program that has a user interface that looks like multiple instances of the same program (such as some versions of Microsoft Word).</li><li>Single document window splitting: window can be split to simultaneously view different areas of a file.</li><li>MDI: Overlappable windows: each opened document gets its own fully movable window inside the editor environment.</li><li>MDI: Tabbed document interface: multiple documents can be viewed as tabs in a single window.</li><li>MDI: Window splitting: splitting application window to show multiple documents (non-overlapping windows).</li></ul></div><div>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic features</div><div><ul><li>Spell checking</li><li>Regex-based find &amp; replace</li><li>Encoding conversion</li><li>Newline conversion</li><li>Multiple undo/redo</li><li>Rectangular block selection</li></ul></div><div><br/></div><div>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Programming features</div><div><ul><li>Syntax highlighting: Displays text in different colors and fonts according to the category of terms.</li><li>Function list: Lists all functions from current file in a window or sidebar and allows user to jump directly to the definition of that function for example by double-clicking on the function name in the list. More or less realtime (does not require creating a symbol database, see below).</li><li>Symbol database: Database of functions, variable and type definitions, macro definitions etc. in all the files belonging to the software being developed. The database can be created by the editor itself or by an external program such as ctags. The database can be used to instantly locate the definition even if it is in another file.</li><li>Bracket matching: Find matching parenthesis or bracket, taking into account nesting.</li><li>Auto indentation: May refer to just simple indenting to the same level as the line above, or intelligent indenting that is language specific, e.g., ensuring a given indent style.</li><li>Code folding</li><li>Text folding</li><li>Compiler integration: Allows running compilers/linkers/debuggers from within editor, capturing the compiler output and stepping through errors, automatically moving cursor to corresponding location in the source file.</li></ul></div><div><br/></div><div>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Extra features</div><div><ul><li>Text shell integration</li><li>Graphical shell integration</li><li>Macro language</li><li>Collaborative editing</li><li>Large file support: In general, most text editors do not support large text files. Some restrict themselves to available in-core RAM while others use sophisticated virtual memory management techniques and paging algorithms.</li><li>Multi-line regex support</li><li>Search in files: Perform search (and possibly replace) in multiple files on disk, for example on a sub-directory and recursively all the directories below it. Similar to grep.</li></ul></div><div><br/></div></body></html>
