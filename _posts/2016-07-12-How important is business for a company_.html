<div>Development needs get ignored much of the time in favour of the more tangible front-end and business requirements.</div>
<div>—Making It Right</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>For every company that considers software product as one of their Key Assets, technical needs should be among their top priorities, alone with business needs and user needs.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>For outsourcing products though, this is often not the case. Outsourcing products are often non-key to client companies, because no company will outsource their key assets. To them, technical needs are often ignored much of the time in favour of the more tangible front-end and business requirements.</div>
<div>But ignoring technical needs only leaves to disaster. That’s why outsourcing products are often short-lived, because they couldn’t live up their own weight and eventually collapse.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>If the debt grows large enough, eventually the company will spend more on servicing its debt than it invests in increasing the value of its other assets.</div>
<div>—Making It Right</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So let’s accept the fact that outsourcing products are by definition crap, unless someone stand up against the ignorance of technical needs. I think we as the ones who bear under the development, should stand up and shout for technical needs. Because if succeeded, it will make everyone’s life better.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Treat business needs and user needs no different than technical needs, they’re born equal. So don’t treat feature testing more important than unit testing.</div>
<div>Long term success over short term success. Meaning alway do the right thing in long term, not short term.</div>
