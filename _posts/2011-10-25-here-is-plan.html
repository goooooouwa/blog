I start to make changes to my life and the world I live in. <br />The question that drives me is: what kind of life do I want to live, or everybody wants to live?<br />We wanna live without bonds and limits, do what we wanna do. We hope everybody can enjoy the cherish of life, enjoy the happiness and sadness.<br />Every time we try to success, and every time we fail, is just what it takes to get things better, and we can hope we shall succeed finally.<br />Many are working very hard everyday to make things better, let's just join them, join the entire human race, to do what we love to do, and make the world a better place. <br />This is my plan.<br />
