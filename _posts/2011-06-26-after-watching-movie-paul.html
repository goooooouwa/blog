&nbsp; &nbsp; A excellent geeky film .Those two guys were&nbsp;frightened when they first saw the alien Paul, that was funny.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; But the truly inspiration this movie gives me is that you should free yourself ,like what the alien said(I can't remember actually).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; It is really important to be free, by all means. Sex, rude words, whatever, just do what you feel happy to, no one can stop you from being a human with truly humanity inside.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; So, that's what I think of this film. Very geeky and funny ,by the way.You should see it, no matter who 'the fuck' you're. :)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1092026/">the IMDb link</a>.
