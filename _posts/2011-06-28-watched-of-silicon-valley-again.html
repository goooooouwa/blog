&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even though the movie is like <i>The Social Network</i>, not telling the truth story, but it really teaches me something.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm not saying that I'm&nbsp;fancy&nbsp;with the Tech&amp;Arts stuff, or being a computer nut.I just find it's important to have&nbsp;belief, belief of something that drives you do what you do. That really gives me the power to give all my passion to the interests that I feel wanna live with.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You life is not about doing a living, is about chasing your dream. Or why do we live our lives?
