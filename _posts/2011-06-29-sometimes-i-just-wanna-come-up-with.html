&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I feel alive when I find some wonderful stuff to play with. That let me be who I am, do what I want.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But the biggest barrier stopping me from doing that is lack of operating knowledge. If you don't know English, it won't be a pleasure to talk with a English person. And it always occurs to me where to find a place you can learn stuff as easily as eating breads.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is a website titled <a href="http://betterexplained.com/">Better Explained</a>.It is for making knowledge to be well explained. I think it shows a thing that people have the needs of acquiring knowledge easily.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But it's not exactly what I wanna talk about. What I truly desire of is&nbsp;equipping&nbsp;knowledge instantly. That's kind of googling things.Fast and literally.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It leads to a question: how do we operate knowledge? We're not dictionaries. We own skills of operating things in ways our brains feel familiar with. <b><i>Sometimes we just personally create reflections between objects to let us remember their relationships.</i></b> It's not literal, but functional. It works for us, humans only.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The&nbsp;organizations&nbsp;of knowledge in our brains are quite different form those in literal.Knowledge in our brains are like maps, we don't know the landscape of a city, but we certainly know how to move from a block to another.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Learning things in landscape is useless for moving us around, we should learn how to operate them instead.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So every time you catch up with some interesting new stuff, the first thing you should question is: <b><i>how do I operate them?</i></b><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you follow this question, and you should soon get yourself the skills you need.
