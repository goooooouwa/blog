The **event target** is where the event occurred, in most cases an HTML element.

The **event** is what happens, for example, click.

The **event listener** is a function that deals with that event.

When an event happens, elements which defined event listener to that event are the event targets, the event listener corresponding to the event on each event target is then executed to deal with that event.
