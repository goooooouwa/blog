# How to get the list of all installed color schemes in Vim

Type

`:colorscheme` then `Space` followed by `TAB`.

or as Peter said,

`:colorscheme` then `Space` followed by `CTRL` `d`

The short version of the command is `:colo` so you can use it in the two previous commands, instead of using the "long form".
