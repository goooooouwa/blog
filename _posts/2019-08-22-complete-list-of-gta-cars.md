I was in another thread and started wondering about which car companies were which in the GTA games.

Through the generous help of many in this subreddit, I've compiled a working list.

Feel free to help me modify and change this list so we get the correct real-world company and the correct GTA company.

Here's the list as compiled in the the thread.

* Ubermacht is BMW
* Pegassi is Lamborghini
* Schyster is Chrysler
* Pfister is Porshe
* Obey is Audi
* Maibatsu is Mitsubishi
* Karin is "generic Asian-company car" (Subaru/Toyota)
* Bravado is Dodge
* Benefactor is Mercedes-Benz
* Dewbauchee is Aston Martin
* Ocelot is Jaguar
* Vapid is Ford
* Hijak is Fisker (/u/WigglyWastebin)
* Tesla is Coil (/u/commiecat)
* Coquette is Corvette (/u/StoneHolder28)
* Nagasaki is Kawasaki (/u/KrabbHD)
* Grotti is Ferrari (/u/Cbach7)
* Karin is Lexus (/u/Deathcube18)
* Karin is Subaru?
* Karin is Toyota?
* Dinka is Honda/Acura (/u/Deathcube18)

I decided to do a little investigative work and find the logos for Real World Companies and compare them to GTA companies. What do you think of the comparisons?
