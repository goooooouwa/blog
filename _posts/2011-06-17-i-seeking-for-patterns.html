<div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm not a sick man living on&nbsp;electronic devices . &nbsp;I'm beyond that .</div><div style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Computer is just a tool , the content on it is what we're seeking for .</div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Programming is a pattern , I've&nbsp;sought for it , and I'm done. The pattern of programming is formal logic . You have to <b>design the logic</b> of your program , to make it functional . After that , you may have to <b>make it&nbsp;efficient</b>&nbsp;. And here comes the pattern of algorithm . And these two are the essential of programming .<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mathematics is the subject that seeks for patterns . I love seeking patterns , that's what I do . So I'm a born mathematician . And the fact is I still need a lot of training to get me going . That's the price I have to pay , and it worths .<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So , next stage : seeking patterns .
