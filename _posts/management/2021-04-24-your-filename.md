Don't expect to finish something tangible in days, no matter how productive you are (unless you are a genius).

don't be fooled by The mythical 10x programmer http://antirez.com/news/112

The making of games or any product, isn't a one man job (forget about those geniuses for a moment), it's hours and hours of teamwork among creative professionals. Daily activities ranging from brainstorming, ideation, management, coordenation, prototyping, production. For some projects, they sometimes do this for 3-5 years, with a team ranging from 10-50 or more.

So instead of dreaming about making some great product as an one man job, like those geniuses, such as Steve Worzniack, Linux Torvards, Marco, people who can make something (wonderful) in days, I should first get this stright: not everything can be built by one man in days. Some genius might be able to start something in days. Even Linus couldn't write all the kernel in days. The core feature maybe is able to be implemeneted in a short time, but a complete package takes more effort.

For one man job, don't expect it to be done in days, unless it's some small jobs. Anything tangible usually takes longer, it's simple math.

Plan your project if it's bigger than a one-week job, even it's hobby side projects, don't expect to finish something in days.
