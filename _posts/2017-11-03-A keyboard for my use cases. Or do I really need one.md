What I want is improved input experience, thus increase productivity. 

Possible options: voice input, ultra portable and comfortable typing device.

结论是，手机不适合硬件键盘，因为便携式键盘即无法同手机一样use it everywhere，也不能typing comfortably as full-size keyboard.

iPad是适合用键盘的，因为similar size and portability between iPad and keyboard.
