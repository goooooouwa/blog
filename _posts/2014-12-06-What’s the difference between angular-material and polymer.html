	<div><b>Common</b></div>

	<div>They both implement the material design spec, but with different approaches.</div>

	<div><br/></div>

	<div><b>Difference</b></div>

	<div>Angular-material uses technologies existing today( HTML5, ES5, Flexbox in CSS3, AngularJS 1.3+ etc) to implement the design spec, so it’s ready to use today with no polyfills.</div>

	<div>Polymer on the other head exists primarily to demonstrate the power of a set of new technologies they call web components. They exists before material design came alone, and they updated their page elements to align with the design spec when it’s introduced. You can’t use polymer today without some polyfills( platform.js).</div>

	<div><b><br/></b></div>

	<div><b>Conclusion</b></div>

	<div>As when the web components become the new standard, AngularJS will use these new technologies to replace the old ones they used to achieve the same effects or even better, just like what they did with AngularJS 2.0( take advantages of new standards like ES6’s class and module to replace current directive definition object and angular.module). And at that time, the purpose of demonstrating web components is fulfilled and polymer has no reason to exist.</div>
