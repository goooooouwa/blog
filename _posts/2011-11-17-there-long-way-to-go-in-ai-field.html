<br /><br />There's still a long way to go. For now, still no one knows how to implement Strong AI, which is real intelligent. At now, we are more like fooling ourselves to let us believe what the machine does is like what we human do,like face detection. But what really happens is that we just let them behave like what we do, in another way which machines can understand but is really not how we do the same job.<br /><br />But it's a good thing that a machine can find our faces in pictures, right?<br /><br />As time goes, we'll be fooled more broadly and more deeply, hopefully eventually we can see no difference between machines and us, in terms of thinking. I think if a machine can do exactly what we're able to do, it's talented enough.There's not really much necessary discuss too deeply about what is true AI at that point.<br /><br />So, let's just wait and see more exciting things happen.
