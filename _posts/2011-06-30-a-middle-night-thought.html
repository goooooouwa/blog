What I take human motive as:<br /><blockquote><b>      We try to see through the messy face of phenomenons, to discover the patterns that manipulate them.</b> To let us get what we can and want to get. There're forces drive us to do so. But more importantly, this is what we really should do. This wrote humans' history and pushes us constantly towards the future. This is what we do, as human race.</blockquote>
