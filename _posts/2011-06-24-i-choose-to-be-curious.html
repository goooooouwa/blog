I was afraid of getting attracted by things that I'm interested .For it may destroy my plan about big future.<br />But from now on,I choose to be curious about anything that I feel happy with.Because I found that it IS the truly way to study, because you're interested in it, at least for that moment. And it's more valuable than all the rest.<br />So,I choose to be curious,truly.
