It’s the date stored in an erasable programmable read-only memory chip in an automobile. 

The computer uses the mapped data to work out the optimum control conditions in which the engine should function. 

The ECU shuffles through the tons of data that come to it in the form of readings to decide the course of action that should be taken by the engine to ensure an ideal drive. 


Fuel map:
It’s a function with Engine Speed and Throttle Position as input and Injection Quantity as output. It basically said how much fuel should be injected at a certain engine speed and throttle position, to achieve superior performance, whether it be more power, cleaner emissions, or better fuel efficiency.

Other parameters that are often mappable are:
Ignition Timing
Rev. limit  
Water temperature correction
Transient fueling
Low fuel pressure modifier
Closed loop lambda

Other examples of advanced functions are:
Waste gate control (controlling boost)
Staged injection
Variable cam timing
Gear control
Anti-lag

What is ECU tuning? Mapping?





Is there such a thing called Transmission Control Unit? Tuning?
yes. And yes.
