&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The fact is we are not in the same world.And I don't like her&nbsp;characteristics&nbsp;,but I wanna be her friend,<i>I think she is useful for me[need proof]</i>.She seems not interested in a&nbsp;relationship with me.But I will proof I'm useful for her.So,what should I do?<br />I have two options:<br /><br /><ol><li>leave her away,be who I am.</li><li>Be with her,keep a distance but stay in touch.</li></ol><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I don't know if I can realize opt #2.But I do know what approach I should take.By that I mean,I will keep doing my things,while in the meantime,take a little&nbsp;effort&nbsp;to surprise her and make her realize that We Are Useful For Each Other.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My goal is let her realize that.But first of all,I have to proof&nbsp;<i>she is useful for me.</i>
