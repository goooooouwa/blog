## TL'DR

你必须经过作者同意才能使用其作品。除非你的行为属于Fair Use，否则任何不经过作者同意的使用都属于侵权。如果作者使用的是Creative Commons Licenses，则表示作者同意你对其作品合理的使用。

## 什么是版权？

根据[Google Legal Help](https://support.google.com/legal/answer/3463239?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiyl4vJ3K3eAhVEEbwKHXczAC4QlZ0DegQIARAC)：

> "Copyright ownership gives the owner the exclusive right to use the work, with some exceptions. When a person creates an original work, fixed in a tangible medium, he or she automatically owns copyright to the work."
> 
> "Many types of works are eligible for copyright protection, for example:
> 
>  * Audiovisual works, such as TV shows, movies, and online videos
>  * Sound recordings and musical compositions
>  * Written works, such as lectures, articles, books, and musical compositions
>  * Visual works, such as paintings, posters, and advertisements 
>  * Video games and computer software
>  * Dramatic works, such as plays and musicals"

## 什么样的转载是侵权？

根据[知乎用户回答](https://www.zhihu.com/question/20218336)：

> "侵权不侵权要看你转载的出处对侵权的定义…… 有一些网站允许署名转载，有一些网站禁止任何形式转载，有一些网站禁止商业用途的转载……等等，不能一概而论~ 你转载之前先问问作者本人的意思就最好了……"

## 什么是Fair Use?

根据 [DMLP项目](http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/fair-use)：

- "The policy behind copyright law is not simply to protect the rights of those who produce content, but to "promote the progress of science and useful arts.""
- "Fair use will not permit you to merely copy another’s work and profit from it, but when your use contributes to society by continuing the public discourse or creating a new work in the process, fair use may protect you."

### 有哪些使用行为属于Fair Use呢？

首先，以下行为属于Fair Use：

> "criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright."

另外，从以下使用的动机和性质也可以推断为Fair Use：

> "the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; the nature of the copyrighted work; the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work."

> "In summary, although courts will balance all four factors when assessing fair use, the fair use defense is most likely to apply when the infringing use involves criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research.  In addition, some general rules of thumb can be helpful in analyzing fair use: A use that transforms the original work in some way is more likely to be a fair use; A non-profit use is more likely to be considered a fair use than a for-profit use; A shorter excerpt is more likely to be a fair use than a long one; and A use that cannot act as a replacement for the original work is more likely to be a fair use than one that can serve as a replacement."

## 关于Creative Commons证书

根据 [Creative Commons网站](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/)：

> "The Creative Commons copyright licenses and tools forge a balance inside the traditional “all rights reserved” setting that copyright law creates. Our tools give everyone from individual creators to large companies and institutions a simple, standardized way to grant copyright permissions to their creative work. The combination of our tools and our users is a [vast and growing digital commons](https://creativecommons.org/videos/a-shared-culture), a pool of content that can be [copied, distributed, edited, remixed, and built upon](https://creativecommons.org/videos/wanna-work-together), all within the boundaries of copyright law."

## 总结

作者本人拥有对其作品的版权。除非你的行为属于Fair Use，否则任何不经过作者同意的使用都属于侵权。作者可以通过使用License来表明允许哪些他人对其作品的使用行为。如果你不希望任何人以任何形式使用你的作品，你可以选择"保留所有权利“（当然仍然不能阻止Fair Use），而如果你愿意将你的作品与他人分享，又希望基本权利得到保护，Creative Commons Licenses应该是不错的选择。
