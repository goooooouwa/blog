### Why do they ask more questions and understand stories better?

NA dev team works directly with Product team and UI team, at the same location in the same timezone, has little cost of communication, it’s cheap to ask questions and thus get better understanding on stories.

### Why do they dare to make decision?

NA dev team makes decisions without consulting CN dev team and QA team( they close Jira tickets, edit story title and point, create a branch with very very long name and do not let anyone else touch it ). If we do the same, they blame us. This also applies to Product team( NA BA outweighs CN BA). We simply don’t have the power to make decisions, that’s why.

### Why are we always fixing bugs instead of taking stories?

CN dev team work alongside QA team, and it’s more likely we will be pointed to fix the bugs they find. That’s why we fix more bugs. Then why do we take less stories? Consider the answers for above questions.
