I love to be a dreamer. But dreaming is not enough to make a difference. You need to actually realize it, make things happen.<br />So what I learned is idea is not everything. To success, you need a lot of stuff, and a lot of work to do. So instead of saying, I need to actually work on something to get what I want.<br />Achieve something is not as easy as it seems. That means you need to dive deeply into the&nbsp;work-ground, to deal with technical problems. Sometimes you will lose your dream, while working too blind. It means you need to do both the thinking and doing.<br />But anyway I decide to do it. Instead of worrying about&nbsp;what cost it may take, I just wanna do what I now feel wanted to do.
