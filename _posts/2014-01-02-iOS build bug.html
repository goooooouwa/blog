I create a new project to build. I copy it over to the problematic project, and uncheck any change tracked by git. I rebuild it, it successes. This means something is wrong with ignored files. So I remove all the .gitignore files. Then I compare new ios project with old one. I notice the difference is old project lacks three buld folders, which is intentionally ignored. I add them back to old project one by one, everytime I rebuild. Finally I noticed one of the "build folders" is actually a <span>shell script named "build" is ignored.</span></div><div><br clear="none"/></div><div>techniques:</div><div><br clear="none"/></div><div>reason:</div><div>The .gitignore file ignores "build" instead of "build/". This causes the problem. This causes a shell script named "build" is ignored.</div></body></html>
