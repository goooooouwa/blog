&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I should consider computer as an information provider , instead of the thing that supports my everyday life , I've way too much&nbsp;relied&nbsp;on it .<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The problem is I'm troubled by noise around me . I wanna be alone when I do some things . So , what should I do ?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I think I should go away .&nbsp;Seriously , I won't repeat what I've suffered in high school , I've grown up . Where should I go ? Or , what kind of life should I live for now ?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What I need is information , or say ' the web ' . Where I can access the internet , I can do what I want to do . That's it .<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So , go wherever you want , just take your laptop and 3G adapter , you're good to go .<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Seriously , you are about to go out , tracing your dream .
