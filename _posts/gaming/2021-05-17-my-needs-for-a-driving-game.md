I've been searching for a fun driving game, after experiencing with a lot of racing & driving games, I now have a better understanding of my own needs of such a game and I found 3 games that are most close to what I want.

My needs for such a game are:

- engaging roads: twisty and elevation
- good driving experience (wheel and force feedback support)
- open feeling
- car enthusiasts vibe, crowd and celebration


The 3 games are:

- Forza Horizon
- Test Drive Unlimited
- Grid



The specific versions are:

- Forza Horizon 1
- Test Drive Unlimited 1
- Grid 1



Here's a comparison of how I feel about these games. There are also other games I find interesting, such as driver: san francisco, burnout paradise, but they are similar not as good as these 3 games, so I will not include them here.
